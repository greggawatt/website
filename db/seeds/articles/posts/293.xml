		<content_encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have just the thing for the final weeks of the US Presidential election spectacle: a new video from our comrades <a href="http://www.testtheirlogik.com/">Test Their Logik</a>, "Democracy's Bankrupt." This anthem eloquently expresses the disillusionment with electoral democracy that is spreading around North America today. Recommended for use alongside our <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/tools/vote/">"Vote Here"</a> stickers and our poster series, <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2012/04/29/poster-series-what-does-democracy-mean/">"What Does Democracy Mean?"</a></p>

<p>Following their debut album, <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2011/07/04/test-their-logik-debut-album-a/">"A,"</a> Test Their Logik's "Democracy's Bankrupt" is the first single off their upcoming album "Be," due to drop on December 21.</p>

<h3>Lyrics</h3>

<p>every politician's already been bought.
capital rules this ballot box.</p>

<p>this pyramid scheme is about to collapse
runnin outta credit outta steam outta gas
healthcare welfare everything is getting slashed
more cops more jails bailouts for the banks
rolling out the tanks to occupy the planet
we occupy a plaza they wanna oscar grant us
murderers working for the people on our ballots
who serve the corporations and the rich and the bankers
all about traffic keep products flowing
profits soaring our wages stay frozen
they shipped every job they could across the ocean
built borders for the people but kept markets open
we waited for change. ain't no use in hoping
the system needs war and slaves to keep floating
so sinking this ship is the path we've chosen
democracy's bankrupt we ain't voting</p>

<p>X2
All power to the people.
If voting changed anything  it would be illegal
those in power have always been deceitful
we're done with voting for a lessor evil
democracy means war, surveillance, prisons,
police, borders, capitalism.
every vote is a vote for the system
act directly make your own decisions</p>

<p>democrat or republican
liberal conservative no hope in them
same shit different asshole fuck votin' man
status quo, their job is preserving it
when revolution comes what they get they deservin it.  the nerve of them
bankers serving them, the federal reserve pyramid they subserviant.
fuck the ballot tear it up or burn it man. power to the people believe
its concerning them.
the tables are turnin, and after obama, the liberal monster, innocent
child drone bomber, stop being depressed realize that we're stronger
this false dichotomy don't believe it any longer.  fuck the ndp the
liberals and harper, they all work for the beast their hearts are
darker.  If voting could change anything it'd be illegal the whole
tree is evil chop it from the root power to the people.</p>

<p>X2
All power to the people.
If voting changed anything  it would be illegal
those in power have always been deceitful
we're done with voting for a lessor evil
democracy means war, surveillance, prisons,
police, borders, capitalism.
every vote is a vote for the system
act directly make your own decisions</p>

<p>yeah yeah let's take back our lives
make our decisions fuck these greedy politicians
yeah yeah the people gonna rise
and start building the world we wanna live in
we don't need em to survive
freedom's misssing in this democratic prison
these pinnochios lie they the true parasites stay free til we die
anarchists we defy
the law. and the rule of our masters
the evil of a lessor none of them are better
they're still all bastards
a multiheaded hydra their heads we're gonna sever.
like our own shackles
liberate by any measure piling up the pressure
no hope in the ballot every vote's a disaster
a voice that's been captured. freedom's what we're after.</p>

<p>X2
All power to the people.
If voting changed anything  it would be illegal
those in power have always been deceitful
we're done with voting for a lessor evil
democracy means war, surveillance, prisons,
police, borders, capitalism.
every vote is a vote for the system
act directly make your own decisions</p>

<p>every politician's already been bought
capital rules this ballot box
every politician's already been bought
capital rules this ballot box
every politician's already been bought
capital rules this ballot box
every politician's already been bought.
capital rules this ballot box</p>
