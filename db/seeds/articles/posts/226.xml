During last June's <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/toronto2.php">G20 protests</a>, the Canadian government brought trumped up conspiracy charges against our friends <a href="http://www.testtheirlogik.com/" target="_blank">Test Their Logik</a>, accusing the hip hop duo of causing the <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/recentfeatures/toronto.php">riot that destroyed downtown</a> with their hit video "<a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2010/06/16/actions-against-the-june-g8-g20-meetings/">Crash the Meeting</a>." The two were imprisoned, then forbidden contact upon release, as part of a <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2010/09/03/overview-toronto-g20-legal-fallout/">massive campaign of repression</a> that ultimately targeted over 1000 people.

In response, we released a <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2010/09/30/test-their-logik-benefit-album/">collection of their material</a> as a benefit for G20 defendants. Now that <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2010/12/15/test-their-logik-g20-update/">the prosecutors have admitted that their charges were groundless</a> and dropped their no-contact injunction, Test Their Logik are back in action and coming harder than ever. Featuring a cameo by fan <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,595682,00.html" target="_blank">Glenn Beck</a> of Fox News, their new video "Conspiracy Rap" sends a big fuck you to the ones who tried to stop them and offers a preview of their first official album, which we'll be helping them release this May. Like "Crash The Meeting," this video was produced by Anarkid, a self-taught multi-media warrior and VJ from Montreal bent on radicalizing the rave scene.

Test Their Logik will be touring extensively this spring to support the release of their new album, showing that resistance cannot be stopped by any amount of repression. Meanwhile, over a dozen people still face serious charges as part of the same conspiracy rap the Canadian government tried to pin on Test Their Logik; the <a href="http://guelphprisonersolidarity.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/support-political-prisoners-of-the-g20/" target="_blank">Guelph Anarchist Black Cross</a> has released <a href="http://guelphprisonersolidarity.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/g20jan30web.pdf" target="_blank">this zine</a> to publicize their situation, which we strongly encourage you to print out and distribute.
