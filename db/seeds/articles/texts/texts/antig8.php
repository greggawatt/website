<h5>Crimepens&eacute;e Eyewitness Account 
of the<br />
Anti-G8 Demonstrations and Anarchy in the Alps</h5>
<p>After 
hours of being herded into airports, terrorized by border 
guards, and adjusting my disguise as a harmless pony-tailed 
animation artist, I arrived at Annemasse. I felt like somewhere 
there should be trumpets, a glorious symphony announcing 
that against all odds this convicted criminal had made in 
past border-guards and hitch-hiked without knowing a word 
of French to a tiny little village in the Alps which served 
as our secret anarchist headquarters.. As travel companions 
I was with an Italian philosopher and an Estonian film student 
(who we had picked up at the airport because &#8220;We looked 
interesting&#8221;) and in my pockets only a few pennies. 
Yet, within only one day we were going to take on the eight 
largest powers on the face of the earth. </p>
<p>I 
was a bit surprised when walking into the <a href="#vaaag">VAAAG</a> 
that it appeared to be some sort of vaguely anarchist Woodstock. 
And a bad corporate one, with high-priced beer and no free 
food in sight. Clearly, something was wrong. I hurriedly 
borrowed the mobiles of strangers to call the crimepens&eacute;e 
agent I had e-mailed only a few hours before he himself 
had begun his own wild hitch-hike to the VAAAG. Within a 
few hours of tramping about looking for him, it became clear&#8212;I 
wasn&#8217;t even at the anarchist camp! I was at the camp 
of the Intergalactic, the camp of the social democrats, 
hippies, and Trotskyists. Of course there was going to be 
bad reggae and overpriced beer! Yet, on the other side of 
the mobile, I could hear the unmistakable sound of punk 
rock, and I could already smell the free food! </p>
<p>Despite 
it being pitch-black, I saw from the torch-lights of the 
VAAAG a tall man who was unmistakably sporting the infamous 
logo of the international conspiracy only known as the CrimethInc 
Ex-Workers Collective. I hurried over and introduced myself, 
and thanks to his perfect grasp of English within a few 
minutes we had a mad-cap plan of crossing the border to 
aid blockades at Lausanne, a smaller Swiss town that the 
G8 delegates were going to ride through early Sunday morning 
in an attempt to avoid the roads near Geneva and Annemasse, 
towns already occupied by hordes of anarchists. Again another 
international border and a lack of Swiss Francs to pay for 
transport could be difficulties, but such things had never 
stopped us before. The forces of anarchy, separated by continents 
and border-guards, had just begun to gather their powers. 
</p><p>The 
Crimepens&eacute;e agent informed me politely that he was 
going to sleep with a young woman, thus making my presence 
inside her tent a bit strange, but that I was welcome to 
sleep right outside. After having a few free cups of tea, 
I gathered my things to go to the bed. Luckily, a woman 
the age of my mother came up to me and in French informed 
me that autonomy included doing the dishes. I thanked her 
and started cleaning the tables. <br>
At the next morning assembly at VAAAG, about two hundred 
rag-tag anarchists of over a dozen different nationalities 
decided it was time to leave France and go to Lausanne, 
consequences be damned! We marched like a small army straight 
to the border between France and Switzerland, where an emergency 
consensus meeting took place over whether or not we were 
going to show our papers to the border-guards. While at 
first it seemed to make sense, a young woman in our group 
revealed that she was already barred from entering Switzerland, 
so if we showed our papers she couldn&#8217;t go through. 
Our group decided on solidarity, that none of us were going 
to show our papers&#8212;and if the guards wanted them, 
they would have to answer to all of us! I was a bit incredulous, 
having been involved in at least one failed border-opening 
before and ever being the pessimist, I asked them if they 
had ever blockaded a border before and if they even knew 
how to blockade a street. They just smiled and said they 
would worry about such things when they happened. Lacking 
their faith, the Crimepens&eacute;e agent and myself marched 
towards the front of the group and prepared for the worst. 
The horde of anarchists behind us began chanting &#8220;No 
Borders, No Nations, Stop Deportations!&#8221;...and marched 
right past the dozen stunned Swiss border guards, who stared 
at us in disbelief. Our international gang reformed after 
its first victory, and came to the conclusion that now in 
Switzerland we had to get to Lausanne as quickly as possible 
before the authorities clamped down on our blatant disregard 
for international migration laws. We would . . . take the 
tram!</p>
<p>Within 
minutes a tram pulled up next to the border, and two hundred 
anarchists filled in completely. I began wondering why we 
didn&#8217;t do these types of seizures of public transportation 
more often. Everyone was smiling, clapping, and soon declared 
our solidarity to make sure we all paid our tram tickets&#8212;after 
we were dead. The seizures of public transportation continued 
unabated at the train station. Within minutes we had figured 
out what train was going to Lausanne, and using my body 
to keep the doors open, began piling in. A nervous conductor 
came up to the Crimepens&eacute;e agent and explained that 
another train was leaving in ten minutes and would get us 
to Lausanne even quicker than this train. He smiled at her, 
thanking her for the advice, but informed her that we were 
sensibly taking the train that was leaving right now. All 
aboard the Anarchy Express!</p><p>Through 
the windows, the Alps and the perfect blue lake of L&eacute;man 
sped by us. Overflowing from the seats, our crew sat on 
our backpacks and chatted excitedly with the locals who 
had made the unfortunate decision to actually pay for the 
train to Lausanne. At Lausanne we were greeted at the train-station 
by a man&#8212;who could in another life pass for a mild-mannered 
barber&#8212; that announced in a few minutes we would have 
a bus headed towards the anarchist base of Camp Bourdonette. 
We arrived at a camp that was well-organized with hot-showers, 
melted Swiss chocolate bars, and a plethora of black and 
red flags. After claiming a bit of ground for Crimepens&eacute;e, 
we decided to head to the squatted Camp Oulalala by the 
lake for a swim to cool-off after a long day of not paying 
for any form of public transportation whatsoever.</p><p>Where 
we greeted by a giant international anarchist beach party! 
I had never seen anything quite like this in my life: the 
amassed forces of the anti-globalization movement sunbathing, 
giving out heaps of free salad, throwing Frisbees nude in 
the lake, and generally having the time of their lives. 
After stripping off my clothes and jumping in the lake, 
I swam to what I can only describe as a ricketedy pirate 
raft built to single-handedly intercept the G8 delegates 
who, too terrified of the protesters to drive to Evian, 
were going to be boated across the lake. Complimenting the 
German crew on their flying the Jolly Roger, I climbed in 
and asked if they really intended to use this raft to intercept 
the G8 delegates and what they would do with them if they 
actually caught them. Although my German is notoriously 
poor, I believe they told me that they would make the heads 
of the eight largest powers in the world walk the plank. 
</p><p>As 
night set in, the discussion got more serious. Somehow having 
found myself in the camp of Germans and German-speaking 
Swiss, the camp starting a very serious discussion about 
how many roads in Lausanne we were going to block and how 
we were going to do it. While all the details were kept 
suitably mysterious, the organizers assured us that &#8220;We 
know how to block roads&#8221; and that &#8220;Supplies 
had been prepared&#8221;. After deciding to stick together, 
the Franco-Germanic Bloc sent a delegate down to the Pink 
and Silver Bloc (which liked dressing up in outrageous pink 
and silver outfits and dancing to the latest in anti-capitalist 
samba music). At the inter-group meeting, it was decided 
that the Samba band would lead the march into Lausanne, 
and a spokesman from &#8220;the Dark Grey Bloc&#8221; announced 
that &#8220;we embraced heterogeneity and dancing, and no-one 
was going to be forced to commit acts of violence they don&#8217;t 
approve of. &#8221;. Hundreds of people clapped and cheered. 
It was going to be one of those days&#8230;tomorrow morning, 
that is. As I went to sleep, the last thing I remember hearing 
was the sound of a radio playing, &#8220;I am the antichrist, 
I am an anarchist, I know what I want and I know how to 
get it&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>Promptly 
at six o&#8217;clock in the morning the teeming masses of 
anarchy gathered outside their camp, with only a lone cop 
on a motorcycle cowardly perched in the distance. As everyone 
wiped their eyes, drank down some coffee, and checked their 
pockets for their vinegar and onions (to defend against 
the tear-gas attacks). Out of nowhere a ridiculously beaten-up 
green van appeared that resembled something that an anarchist 
Che Guevara would drive straight into the apocalypse. To 
my surprise it began blasting an eclectic and tasteful mix 
of everything from German streetpunk, techno, and hip-hop 
through speakers mounted on its roof. This tasteful choice 
in music got even my hips swaying in the morning sun, and 
some sections of the Black Bloc started dancing. The music 
was interrupted occasionally by news in both German and 
English: &#8220;The roads have already been blocked in Geneva!&#8221; 
Cheering broke loose, but we all realized we were running 
behind schedule. Where was the Pink and Silver Bloc when 
you needed them? Our mysterious radio host announced &#8220;The 
Pink and Silver have lost their Samba band&#8230;if anyone 
sees a Samba band, please tell them!&#8221; After a few 
more minutes of frustration, from the distance the unmistakable 
sound of Samba drums was heard. Triumphantly, we took over 
the highway and without a cop is sight began marching straight 
towards downtown Lausanne. </p><p>As 
regards preparation, this Black Bloc had definitely done 
their homework. Bottles of paint were distributed, blocks 
of wood gathered in carts, and huge tripods were carried. 
Indeed, the Bloc was ready for blockading. One Crimepens&eacute;e 
agent was simply handed a pair of bolt-cutters with a wink! 
Ever apt at improvisation, anarchists began splitting off 
from the main march and seizing every available dumpster 
(including those chained to the ground!) for use as blockades. 
The Bloc, still on the outskirts of the city, began approaching 
when a Crimepens&eacute;e Independent Revolutionary Cell 
noticed a Shell petro station in the distance. Hoping that 
everyone would get the message, he began yelling &#8220;Shell! 
Shell! To hell with Shell!&#8221; Within seconds, members 
of the Bloc started throwing stones and paint. The level 
of struggle was raised when yet another Crimepens&eacute;e 
agent, bolt-cutters in hand, aimed straight at the window! 
Within a minute, some of the more enterprising members of 
the Bloc also rushed at the windows and began smashing them 
with their boots, iron bars, whatever was at hand. As the 
corner was turned, an Esso appeared, and the Bloc began 
reducing it to rumble as quickly as possible. The sound-van 
reminded everyone not to spend all their time destroying 
multi-nationals, but to remember that we were here to blockade 
roads. Inside the Esso, the Bloc triumphantly seized everything 
from cigarettes to flowers, destroying as much of the Shell 
station as they could in the process. A few of the more 
enterprising members of the Bloc even grabbed oil for lighting 
future blockades on fire. The process continued like clockwork, 
and a Select station around the corner was just asking for 
it. </p><p>As 
soon as we came to the first intersection to blockade, the 
Black Bloc acted in a way that can only be considered professional. 
Boards, crow-bars, and dumpsters were artfully assembled, 
and as an artist would be a finishing touch on their masterpiece, 
lit on fire. Several members of the Bloc stood back to admire 
their handiwork, lighting their cigarettes on the burning 
wreckage. Cars began backing up, and a few members of the 
Bloc waved, and one driver actually waved back! The entire 
main roundabout outside Lausanne was blocked! As the Black 
Bloc continued its march straight into town, it didn&#8217;t 
encounter any police resistance since the Pink and Silver 
Bloc kept the police line confused with their antics and 
music just a few hundred meters from where the Black Bloc 
was setting up the blockades. As one intersection was entered, 
the Black Bloc began skillfully disassembling entire construction 
sites, using every available and imaginable part of the 
construction equipment that could be possibly turned into 
a barricade. A full-scale wooden fence appeared on one side 
of the intersection, another began to be filled with dumpsters 
and an iron bars. The Bloc in its excitement even began 
blockading even the side of the street they came from, but 
soon realized that they were blockading the escape route 
as well, and then dismantled the blockade as quickly as 
they put it up. Another overeager young member of the Bloc 
smashed the window to a small shop, claiming in defense 
that this shop primarily sold meat and so should be destroyed 
in the name of animal liberation. A quick debate on the 
merits of the action took place, and finally the group more 
or less decided that the negative reaction from locals outweighed 
the possible advantages. In the meantime, a Black Blocker 
with a megaphone reminded the crowd that lighting fires 
in residential neighborhoods might possibly burn down a 
residence, so &#8220;Cool the flames, but not the enthusiasm&#8230;we 
have all day!&#8221; The locals came out on their window 
still and street corners, to view the passing spectacle. 
Expecting probably nothing less than a horde of murderous 
barbarians as advertised by the police and the media, the 
locals were pleasantly surprised when the Black Bloc began 
throwing packs of cigarettes onto the balconies into the 
arms of surprised grandmothers, and giving brightly colored 
flowers to shocked store clerks. Never has rioting been 
so joyous! </p><p>Such 
hours of insurrection are not to last forever, and if they 
did perhaps we would forget their sweetness. Suddenly, from 
the distance tear-gas could be smelled wafting into the 
air. Screaming and running, a cross-dressing Italian in 
a full pink skirt and silver wings announced that the Pink 
and Silver Bloc was being attacked by the pigs and needed 
help! </p>
<p> As the Black Bloc moved forward, the Pink and Silver Bloc 
fell back even more, and despite the steady-stream of tear-gas 
canisters falling around the unmistakable view of a giant 
water cannon could be seen, ruthlessly spraying the Pink 
and Silver Bloc. It was pure cowardice on the part of the 
pigs to attack the Pink and Silver street party first&#8230;and 
together, the Pink and Silver joined the Black Bloc to fight 
back. While black-masked blockaders and pink fairies managed 
to fight back by erected barricades from barbwire, burning 
cardboard, and an over-turned wagon&#8212;buying the crowd 
some needed breathing time&#8212;a tactical retreat was 
in order. Unfortunately, the retreat was anything but tactical, 
as a thoroughly mixed-up Black and Pink Bloc separated and 
went down two separate streets. This was a clear recipe 
for disaster, and within the hour the group our affinity 
group was with was surrounded by cops who were clearly going 
to close in within a few minutes. After a moment of quick 
thinking, our affinity group de-blocked (which means simply 
removing your black mask and replacing your monochrome outfit 
with suitably middle-class apparel such as a button-downed 
plaid shirt) and jumped a fence into a residential neighborhood. 
This neighborhood was peaceful, and as our affinity group 
crawled out of the well-manicured lawn, we surprised an 
older man who was quietly walking his dog from a running 
riot. Giving him a quick wink, we saw the other main split-off 
group. Re-blocking, we desperately tried to convince them 
that to rejoin the group that was surrounded by police just 
surrounded by police just down the street, but our pleas 
were ignored and following the usual and depressing herd 
instinct of crowds, the group just began marching down the 
nearest empty street. Obligingly, the cops followed and 
as the crowd approached an open park, began openly pelting 
people with tear-gas canisters and attacking the crowd with 
truncheons. Seeing as the crowd had lost its earlier co-ordination 
and morale, things were only going to go downhill&#8212;a 
point proved as the crowd panicked again and started running 
across the park to escape the tear-gas. Jumping in the middle 
of yet another crowd of pink pixies in order to de-block, 
our affinity group decided to call it a day in Lausanne 
and walk back to camp to attempt to get whatever remained 
of the demonstration to Geneva. As we walked back to camp, 
we smiled as dumbfounded police and Shell employees began 
picking through the smashed remains of their store. All&#8217;s 
well that ends well&#8212;or at least ends with the capitalists 
suffering at least as much as they make us suffer. </p>
<p>Back 
at Camp Bourdonette, the main crowd was being herded down 
the street by riot police, who in a move of unexpected chutzpah 
blocked the crowd off from returning to Camp Oulalala by 
the lake where the protesters had left their personal belongings. 
The crowd, confused, meandered up the hill to Bourdonette 
and the police followed, surrounding us in order not to 
allow anyone to exit. My mind racing, it became apparent 
that the cops were at best going to at least quarantine 
us in this camp, and at worse come inside the camp and beat 
the living daylights out of us. Thinking of School Diaz 
in Genoa, our affinity group hurriedly gathered their things 
and announced to other affinity groups that the time to 
leave was now or never. Almost everyone else decided it 
would be useful to wait to see what would happen, and perhaps 
retrieve their possessions from Camp Oulalala by the lake. 
We smiled, told everyone to meet us in Geneva, and made 
a mad-cap dash across the street to some woods, where the 
cops had yet to blockade. Manically rushing through underbrush, 
we ended up in the parking lot of a graveyard, and peering 
down the street, noticed that cops were already blocking 
off the exit, but the pigs didn&#8217;t see us. </p>
<p>Some 
of our erstwhile comrades panicked and fled into the graveyard, 
but our affinity group kept a level head by asking a polite 
old couple who were loading their van if they would be kind 
enough to save our freedom from the encroaching police. 
At first they seemed a bit surprised and maybe a little 
bit scared too&#8230;we told them the police was attacking 
the camp and that their ride was our only way out, our only 
way to avoid jail, emphasizing the drama with wild gesticulations 
and our eyes begging for help. Calmly, the old man stared 
at us with a look of peace and answered quietly: &#8220;Okay . . . 
Let&#8217;s go quick then&#8221;. We hid our backpacks in 
the trunk, jumped in the suburban van and thanked them a 
million times in a mixture of French and English. We were 
still anxious that the police would stop the van (As for 
the two of our crew fled into the graveyard&#8212;writing 
this four days later we still don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re 
still hiding there!) but we couldn&#8217;t help but smile 
as we the van sped past police lines without a problem. 
Not only did they help us escape the police blockades, the 
couple were actually going in the direction of Geneva: Wooo-hoo! 
Inside the car, the radio blathered on about &#8220;a degenerating 
riot of wild youth&#8221; in Lausanne, and we could barely 
help ourselves from bursting out in laughter, leaving our 
hosts perplexed. We started to talk with them about the 
G8 and even those &#8220;not-so-nice kids breaking things 
down&#8221;. We went to great pains to emphasize that all 
that was broken, burnt, wrecked, and plundered belonged 
to large multi-national corporations, and that if you take 
into account all the damage and killings caused by their 
neo-liberalism our strike back was not only minute, but 
understandable. They seemed dubious, so we switched the 
subject and talked about how violent the police were (which 
was true on some level, but given our blockades and property 
destruction not particularly surprising, but it&#8217;s 
always important to give pigs a bad name!). We were driving 
for maybe fifteen minutes when the old man told us he would 
then take a secret countryside road as the police were controlling 
the entry of all large towns. We thanked them again for 
going out of their way, and one of out company muttered, 
&#8220;Damn, it felt so good to be a gangster!&#8221; . . . and 
even better to find local accomplices! The elderly couple 
shook our hands, leaving us at the train station of a small 
town ten minutes away from Geneva.</p>
<p>A 
few minutes later we arrive at the Geneva station (without 
paying for our train tickets!) and head towards the Indymedia 
Center at &#8220;L&#8217;Usine&#8221;, hoping to meet friends 
there and find out if there was any action still going on. 
Once inside L&#8217;Usine, free beers and orange juice in 
hand, we were told the camp in Lausanne had been attacked 
by the police and that they arrested over 150 people more 
or less at random, questioning them as regards property 
destruction. Hundreds of others being held hostage without 
the permission to leave the camp until they released their 
papers to the pigs. After relaying our escape on the Indymedia 
Radio, we decided it was time to take a well-deserved rest. 
According to all the news &#8220;from the front&#8221; on 
Indymedia, police repression was intensifying everywhere; 
and with most of the demonstrations coming to an end, we 
decided not to try out luck but to leave Switzerland as 
soon as possible. </p>
<p>We 
walked across all of Geneva under the bright sun, utterly 
exhausted yet still on alert since hundreds of cops were 
keeping anyone who looked like a protester under tight surveillance. 
After a really long walk we arrived at a station where a 
train was supposed to bring us back to Annemasse&#8230;but 
due to the fucking demonstrations it was closed! One of 
us noticed an Amnesty International van parked nearby so 
we decided to beg for them to bring us to the border. They 
were surprised to be interrupted from their note-taking, 
as Amnesty International were there to document political 
repression, but we managed to convince them that our affinity 
group was likely going to be another victim of repression 
itself for their files unless they got us across that border! 
While they at first drug their feet and told us to wait 
till nearly darkness, so that we should walk there instead; 
ten kilometers by foot with heavy backpacks after a day 
of riots, quick escapes, and sun burns: What a great idea, 
Amnesty!! Fortunately a young woman finished her work for 
the day and accepted to bring us back to the VAAAG in Annemasse. 
We thanked this kind stranger a million times, even though 
we all fell asleep in her car while she was still talking 
to us. As she dropped us off in Annemasse, people ran up 
to us and told us that just a few minutes ago the Indymedia 
Centre in Geneva was attacked by the under-cover police, 
who not only checked the papers of but violently beat many 
media activists, arresting twelve under the auspices of 
searching for the ever-elusive &#8220;Black Bloc&#8221;. 
Luckily, by raiding a media center caught their under-handed 
tactics live on camera! We felt horrible, but at the same 
time breathed yet another sigh of relief for following our 
trustworthy instincts. Yes, the G8 did manage to meet in 
Evian, but we definitely gave them a taste of the hell their 
political policies were inflicting on the rest of the world. 
As our group of anarchist conspirators and criminals drifted 
to sleep in this strange autonomous zone that had appeared 
from out of nowhere, we could not help but to realize that 
despite all their teargas, border-guards, water-cannons, 
over-priced train tickets, and secret meetings we had these 
presidents and premiers running scared. The amassed forces 
of the world&#8217;s eight most powerful countries not only 
failed to stop us, but couldn&#8217;t even catch us! And 
there&#8217;s no sleep like the sleep of after a job&#8212;or 
insurrection&#8212;well-done. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="vaaag" id="vaaag"></a>VAAAG:</h2>
<h3 style="padding-top: 0px">Village for Human and Anarchist Experimentation</h3>
<p>Although 
the main demonstration (Where you can smash corporations 
and burn capitalism down!) was on Sunday, we decided to 
leave on Thursday as we had heard of some &#8220;anarchist 
camp&#8221; taking place one week before the G8 summit. 
So the three of us left the dirty industrial town of R---- 
and escaped to the green mountain retreat of the Alps. We 
were definitely a strange crew: a half-mad Belgian hobo 
(retired from a career as a punk rock star too!) and two 
other hardcore kids trying to be a bit more punk. Amazingly, 
all three of us together hitch-hiked the 700 km separating 
us from our upcoming battle in a day, and in the process 
had a really nice picnic with some old people we almost 
converted to anti-capitalism. We arrived at the VAAAG (The 
Alternative Anti-capitalist Anti-war Village) in the evening, 
where we were welcomed at the entrance by young men who 
explained us the way the village worked. The VAAAG consisted 
of around 1500 people living&#8212;in the best possible 
sense of the word&#8212; in one big field. The VAAAG was 
composed of tents offering a vast array of activities such 
as punk shows, debates, workshops on every imaginable issue, 
video-showings, legal advice, medical assistance, a nursery, 
an Indymedia Center, and more. The VAAAG itself was divided 
into &#8220;barrios&#8221;, each barrio being grouped around 
a communal kitchen. Every morning there was an assembly 
in each barrio to figure out what was going great and what 
should be improved. Two delegates of each barrio would meet 
at noon with other delegates to share everyone&#8217;s ideas 
and recommendations. If you didn&#8217;t feel at ease in 
your barrios you could switch barrios at any time. As we 
sat around a fire in front of which people were discussing, 
singing, and playing guitar, and we went to the first kitchen 
tent we found. The smell of awesome vegan food reminded 
us of our empty stomachs. One of the members of the barrio 
explained to us that the food was free, made by everyone 
for everyone, but that a contribution would be great to 
help paying for the camp fees. We gave a couple of euros 
and had a marvellous time eating tons of pasta and sauce 
around the fire. In the tradition of hobo elitism, we had 
no tent so we just fell asleep on our sleeping bags outside. 
The bright sun woke us up pretty early, and within minutes 
we were in the middle of the morning assembly. We were surrounded 
by a heterogeneous crowd of fifty people: young crusties, 
old ladies, middle-aged hippies&#8230;.basically people 
of all kinds. The assembly figured out who would take care 
of the kitchen, the entrance, the camp security, and all 
other pressing matters for the day. The discussion was rolling 
from one person to another in a impressive and polite manner 
(Although in the assembly next to us, these old anarchists 
were all shouting at each other, which while sounding cool 
and passionate, probably got less done!). Someone came up 
with the idea of creating a team to clean up toilets and 
the camp in general. At this point an elderly man raised 
his voice for the first time, explaining that he thought 
we should avoid this kind of specialization as it was everyone&#8217;s 
duty to keep the camp clean, not a handful of unlucky volunteers! 
After maybe an hour, we left the assembly and dispersed 
into the camp. It was really amazing seeing anarchy in action. 
In one corner of the village an old man was building a small 
swimming pool for two little children out a mysterious giant 
pipe, some strings, and a plastic container&#8230;and just 
a few meters away some women was constructing a solar-heater 
to have a hot shower. There were so many things going on 
it was dazzling: constant debates and video showings, kids 
running free without parental supervision, friends gathering 
to peel vegetables and prepare food. Anarchy in fucking 
action, dude. The only problem we encountered was a couple 
of days later, when we had an assembly to decide what to 
do concerning the 150 arrested demonstrators in Lausanne. 
It was hard to find a consensus as we wanted to show authorities 
we were in solidarity with them but didn&#8217;t want our 
camp to fall to the same fate as the camps that morning 
in Lausanne. There was actually no &#8220;right&#8221; choice, 
so people had a hard time figuring this out. Finally, the 
decision was that the people too tired to demonstrate again 
would stay in the village to prevent a police attack while 
others would assemble in front of the city hall in Annemasse 
to offer food and talk to the locals, showing the town people 
that these crazy anarchists were not just about smashing 
windows but about building a better world as well. </p><p> 
Sometimes, we&#8217;re so stuck in this world of shit we 
find it hard to believe in anything. That makes communities 
like the VAAAG all the more powerful as we realize anarchy 
is not just a refusal of their system but a real convergence 
of creative and unique desires, an army of diehard dreamers 
bent on making those dreams reality and making reality our 
dreams. </p>
<p> While only forty kilometers away from here in the VAAAG 
the eight richest countries of the world were going to meet 
in order to figure out how to go on fucking everyone, we
