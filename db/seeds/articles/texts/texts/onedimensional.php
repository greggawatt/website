<h1>One Dimensional Man  in the Three Dimensional World</h1>
<h5>Why abstractions, norms, and absolutes <br />
are an 
assault on humanity and existence itself. </h5>
<h3>&quot;A woman can never be too rich or too thin.&quot;</h3>
<p> The anorexic and the body builder are both pursuing ideals that recede 
before them. Once one starts to measure oneself against a one-dimensional 
standard, such as strength or slimness, too much is never enough: the 
goal is always ahead of you, no matter how far you go. These ideals cannot 
be reached in this world. . . but if you follow them far enough, they 
can lead you out of it, into the abyss which is their true domain&#151;as Arnold 
Schwarznegger's early heart problems, and the suicides of our rock stars 
and sex symbols, clearly attest. </p>
<p>It's true that Arnold Schwarznegger, Hollywood actresses, and others 
like them were practically factory farmed by this competition-obsessed 
society; but the rest of us are infected with these values too&#151;think of 
us as free range versions of the same livestock. All our judgments, all 
our conceptualizations of the world refer to absolutes and ideals: Sara 
is pretty, but not as pretty as Diana, who is not as pretty as the girl 
on the magazine cover; Jane is smart, but not as smart as the boy who 
was accepted to Harvard, who clearly is not as intelligent as Albert Einstein 
was; serving free food is revolutionary, but not as revolutionary as setting 
a police station on fire. We are truly one-dimensional thinkers: unable 
to see each individual quality or action for what it is alone, only able 
to apprehend it in terms of how it compares to others. . . the implication 
being that there is some fundamental scale against which <i>everything</i> can be compared. This is one way of conceiving of the world, yes, but 
not the only way, and not the best way in most circumstances, either. </p>
<p>This way of thinking makes everything into a competition, for those who 
don't want to accept their inferiority; it makes us disregard the value 
and unique significance of every event and entity, in favor of finding 
a place for them in the system of calibration. The truth is that every 
human being really does have a value unlike any other, every radical action 
and approach is important to &quot;the revolution&quot; in irreplaceable ways (the 
important question is <i>not</i> which means to apply, but how to make 
them complement each other), and we desperately need ways to articulate 
this to ourselves.<b> We need a language with which we can celebrate through 
description, not comparison.</b> Without this, no matter how clearly we 
know we should value every little thing for its own sake, we are trapped 
by the assumptions of our own means of expression:</p>
<h6><i>&quot;I love you,&quot;</i> whispers the young girl.</h6>
<h6><i>&quot;Do you love me more than anyone else, more than anything?&quot;</i> demands 
the boy. </h6>
<h6><i>&quot;I love you . . . differently, because of what you are. Not more, not 
less&#151;there's no comparison with love, for love cherishes what is. Love 
is not judgment, it is measureless, matchless . . .&quot;</i> she replies&#151;but 
he has already turned away.</h6>
<p> Where did this obsession with one-dimensional standards come from? It 
originated with language itself: where one word serves to represent many 
different individual experiences, abstraction is already present. When 
you say &quot;sunlight, &quot; it seems as if you are designating a thing that exists 
in the world somewhere, when actually you are referring to a multitude 
of experiences, all different but with some very basic similarities. <b><i>What 
is most precious in experiences is not the lowest common denominators, 
but the once-in-a-lifetime particulars&#151;</i></b> but words leave those 
out entirely. What use is a word that only applies to one moment of one 
individual's experience? That is not a currency that can retain value 
from one to another, and thus is useless for communication. Communication 
is a necessary part of being human; but it is crucial that each of us 
remembers that no word or concept could ever capture the infinite depth 
and complexity of a single instant of life. </p>
<p>The birth of Western civilization, which is founded upon one dimensional 
thinking, occurred in ancient Greece, when Plato took the abstraction 
of language one step farther. Plato declared that our abstractions referred 
to some &quot;higher&quot; world of ideals, in which &quot;courage&quot; and &quot;honor&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; 
exist in their pure form; in doing so, he turned everything backwards, 
placing our broad generalizations before the experiences they are drawn 
from, and claiming that it is those vague generalizations that have truth. 
Thus he took the reference point of our concepts out of the world altogether, 
suggesting that our real experiences in it are unimportant, irrelevant. 
Paul, the founder of Christianity, extended this philosophy into the world 
of religion: the &quot;ideal&quot; existed in heaven, and the earth was the flawed, 
evil imitation of it. </p>
<p>Ideas and doctrines alone were not enough to bend human experience of 
the world to the system of absolutes, of course. Against the wisdom of 
bodily experience, in which the unique qualities of every entity and event 
are encountered up close, they were powerless. But slowly, it became possible 
to enforce the doctrine of the ideal upon the world of daily perception. </p>
<p>It began with the end of the barter system, and the beginning of subdivided 
time. Suddenly, everything had a certain, set value, and the day was divided 
into measured segments. Time and worth cannot really be measured&#151;the man 
who has truly lived knows that the stopwatch cannot capture the way time 
speeds up when he is in bed with his boyfriend and slows down when he 
is &quot;on the clock&quot; at work, he knows that the best and worst things in 
life cannot be &quot;deserved&quot; or earned, let alone appraised&#151;but the pay-by-the-hour 
jobs of the exchange economy forced people to measure them anyway, and 
the habit sunk in. </p>
<p> Soon, everything was measured and calibrated: women's clothing sizes, 
for example. Until the end of the nineteenth century, women's clothing 
was made by hand, for individual women. A woman was seen as possessing 
distinct personal qualities, not as a &quot;size 6&quot; or &quot;plus size.&quot; It's very 
telling that over the last few decades, the perfect ideal of the woman 
has been described numerically&#151;&quot;36-24-36&quot;&#151;and anything that varies from 
that perfect Platonic form is less than beautiful. Women now occupy a 
scale of value according to their measured weight. Some struggle with 
scales every morning, hoping the number will be lower so their value will 
be greater. </p>
<p>It only remained for brand names to finish reducing the real complexity 
of the world to the empty simplicity of abstractions. Once upon a time, 
human beings had gardens; in those days, every fruit or vegetable was 
unique, and looked it. Now our food is scientifically engineered to total 
uniformity, and comes with a brand name identifying which absolute it 
represents: the supermarket's generic brand is the Platonic form of the 
&quot;inferior banana, &quot; the name-brand banana is the perfect incarnation of 
the banana as abstraction, and the archetypal banana of the rich, eco-elitist 
consumers comes marked &quot;organic.&quot; </p>
<p>Those who would resist these attempts to bend the real world to the flatness 
of the conceptual world often fall into the same practices. The world 
of political theory is rife with abstraction and one dimensional thinking. 
Many make it through childhood with their ability to appreciate the irreplaceable 
details of life intact, only to fall to the maladies of generalizing and 
idealizing when they begin to read theory and attempt to form an &quot;analysis&quot; 
of life: their impressions and emotions are converted into an ideology, 
and where their struggles and goals once referred to real people they 
now see those people only as playing pieces in a war of symbols. </p>
<p> Ultimately, the pursuit of &quot;ideals&quot; which cannot exist in this world 
constitutes a rejection of this world, the real world, and thus of life 
itself&#151;as demonstrated by the sad fate of the body builders and anorexics 
who take it to its logical extreme, the grave. We are so used to denigrating 
this world, saying it is a fucked up, imperfect place&#151;and so it appears, 
compared with our &quot;perfect&quot; standards and ideals, which seem so perfect 
only because they cannot exist. A truly radical resolution would be to 
embrace existence just as it is, as the only thing that matters, to proclaim 
that this world itself is heaven, made for our total enjoyment and fulfillment. 
. . and then, to ask:<i> If that's the case, how do we act accordingly? 
What have we been doing wrong all this time?</i> </p>
<p> In doing so, we would finally have to accept and embrace ourselves exactly 
as we are, in all our diversity and variety, and free ourselves from the 
shadow of the false heaven of Plato and the advertising agents, where 
&quot;real&quot; beauty supposedly resides. Liberated entirely from standards, from 
the lingering ghost of Christian judgment and condemnation, we could see 
that <i>what we are</i> must itself constitute the measure and meaning 
of beauty, of dignity and magnificence, if such concepts are to exist 
at all. </p>
<h6>I took off my paint-splattered jacket and my shirt, and gazed at myself 
in the mirror of the airplane restroom. What I saw was something I had 
only glimpsed before in the eyes of my most adoring lovers: the curves 
and textures of my skin, the scars and tattoos and lines cut into it 
painted a picture together, telling a life of wild adventure and undreamable 
extremes, a story more poignant and thrilling than any other. I was 
beautiful&#151;beauty itself was incarnated in me, as the vessel of a world 
of struggles and longings and triumphs bigger than anything that could 
fit in any book. It was a moment of blinding brilliance, but I rested 
comfortably in it, confident, as if I had known through all the squalor 
and desperation that I was simply being primed for this. And, for once, 
I felt that I could live a hero's life as well as die a warrior's death. </h6>
<h5> It is only now that I can recognize your beauty 
<br />and deny no part of my own.</h5>
