<h1>Your Politics Are Boring As Fuck</h1>
<h6>by Nadia C.</h6>
<br>
<h5> Face it, your politics are boring as fuck.</h5> 
<p> You know it's true. Otherwise, why does everyone cringe when you say 
the word? Why has attendance at your anarcho-communist theory discussion 
group meetings fallen to an all-time low? Why has the oppressed proletariat 
not come to its senses and joined you in your fight for world liberation? 
</p>
<p> Perhaps, after years of struggling to educate them about their victimhood, 
you have come to blame them for their condition. They must want to be 
ground under the heel of capitalist imperialism; otherwise, why do they 
show no interest in your political causes? Why haven't they joined you 
yet in chaining yourself to mahogany furniture, chanting slogans at carefully 
planned and orchestrated protests, and frequenting anarchist bookshops? 
Why haven't they sat down and learned all the terminology necessary for 
a genuine understanding of the complexities of Marxist economic theory? 
</p>
<p> The truth is, your politics are boring to them because they really are 
irrelevant. They know that your antiquated styles of protest&#151;your marches, 
hand held signs, and gatherings&#151;are now powerless to effect real change 
because they have become such a predictable part of the status quo. They 
know that your post-Marxist jargon is off-putting because it really is 
a language of mere academic dispute, not a weapon capable of undermining 
systems of control. They know that your infighting, your splinter groups 
and endless quarrels over ephemeral theories can never effect any real 
change in the world they experience from day to day. They know that no 
matter who is in office, what laws are on the books, what "ism"s the intellectuals 
march under, the content of their lives will remain the same. They&#151;we&#151;know 
that our boredom is proof that these "politics" are not the key to any 
real transformation of life. For our lives are boring enough already! 
</p>
<p> And you know it too. For how many of you is politics a responsibility? 
Something you engage in because you feel you should, when in your heart 
of hearts there are a million things you would rather be doing? Your volunteer 
work&#151;is it your most favorite pastime, or do you do it out of a sense 
of obligation? Why do you think it is so hard to motivate others to volunteer 
as you do? Could it be that it is, above all, a feeling of guilt that 
drives you to fulfill your "duty" to be politically active? Perhaps you 
spice up your "work" by trying (consciously or not) to get in trouble 
with the authorities, to get arrested: not because it will practically 
serve your cause, but to make things more exciting, to recapture a little 
of the romance of turbulent times now long past. Have you ever felt that 
you were participating in a ritual, a long-established tradition of fringe 
protest, that really serves only to strengthen the position of the mainstream? 
Have you ever secretly longed to escape from the stagnation and boredom 
of your political "responsibilities"? </p>
<p> It's no wonder that no one has joined you in your political endeavors. 
Perhaps you tell yourself that it's tough, thankless work, but somebody's 
got to do it. The answer is, well, NO. </p>
<p> You actually do us all a real disservice with your tiresome, tedious 
politics. For in fact, there is nothing more important than politics. 
NOT the politics of American "democracy" and law, of who is elected state 
legislator to sign the same bills and perpetuate the same system. Not 
the politics of the "I got involved with the radical left because I enjoy 
quibbling over trivial details and writing rhetorically about an unreachable 
utopia" anarchist. Not the politics of any leader or ideology that demands 
that you make sacrifices for "the cause." But the politics of our everyday 
lives. When you separate politics from the immediate, everyday experiences 
of individual men and women, it becomes completely irrelevant. Indeed, 
it becomes the private domain of wealthy, comfortable intellectuals, who 
can trouble themselves with such dreary, theoretical things. When you 
involve yourself in politics out of a sense of obligation, and make political 
action into a dull responsibility rather than an exciting game that is 
worthwhile for its own sake, you scare away people whose lives are already 
far too dull for any more tedium. When you make politics into a lifeless 
thing, a joyless thing, a dreadful responsibility, it becomes just another 
weight upon people, rather than a means to lift weight from people. And 
thus you ruin the idea of politics for the people to whom it should be 
most important. For everyone has a stake in considering their lives, in 
asking themselves what they want out of life and how they can get it. 
But you make politics look to them like a miserable, self-referential, 
pointless middle class/bohemian game, a game with no relevance to the 
real lives they are living out. </p>
<p> What should be political? Whether we enjoy what we do to get food and 
shelter. Whether we feel like our daily interactions with our friends, 
neighbors, and coworkers are fulfilling. Whether we have the opportunity 
to live each day the way we desire to. And "politics" should consist not 
of merely discussing these questions, but of acting directly to improve 
our lives in the immediate present. Acting in a way that is itself entertaining, 
exciting, joyous&#151;because political action that is tedious, tiresome, and 
oppressive can only perpetuate tedium, fatigue, and oppression in our 
lives. No more time should be wasted debating over issues that will be 
irrelevant when we must go to work again the next day. No more predictable 
ritual protests that the authorities know all too well how to deal with; 
no more boring ritual protests which will not sound like a thrilling way 
to spend a Saturday afternoon to potential volunteers&#151;clearly, those won't 
get us anywhere. Never again shall we "sacrifice ourselves for the cause." 
For we ourselves, happiness in our own lives and the lives of our fellows, 
must be our cause! </p>
<p> After we make politics relevant and exciting, the rest will follow. 
But from a dreary, merely theoretical and/or ritualized politics, nothing 
valuable can follow. This is not to say that we should show no interest 
in the welfare of humans, animals, or ecosystems that do not contact us 
directly in our day to day existence. But the foundation of our politics 
must be concrete: it must be immediate, it must be obvious to everyone 
why it is worth the effort, it must be fun in itself. How can we do positive 
things for others if we ourselves do not enjoy our own lives? </p>
<p>To make this concrete for a moment: an afternoon of collecting food from 
businesses that would have thrown it away and serving it to hungry people 
and people who are tired of working to pay for food&#151;that is good political 
action, but only if you enjoy it. If you do it with your friends, if you 
meet new friends while you're doing it, if you fall in love or trade funny 
stories or just feel proud to have helped a woman by easing her financial 
needs, that's good political action. On the other hand, if you spend the 
afternoon typing an angry letter to an obscure leftist tabloid objecting 
to a columnist's use of the term "anarcho-syndicalist," that's not going 
to accomplish shit, and you know it. </p>
<p>Perhaps it is time for a new word for "politics," since you have made 
such a swear word out of the old one. For no one should be put off when 
we talk about acting together to improve our lives. And so we present 
to you our demands, which are non-negotiable, and must be met as soon 
as possible&#151;because we're not going to live forever, are we? </p>
<p> 1. Make politics relevant to our everyday experience of life again. 
The farther away the object of our political concern, the less it will 
mean to us, the less real and pressing it will seem to us, and the more 
wearisome politics will be. </p>
<p> 2. All political activity must be joyous and exciting in itself. You 
cannot escape from dreariness with more dreariness. </p>
<p> 3. To accomplish those first two steps, entirely new political approaches 
and methods must be created. The old ones are outdated, outmoded. Perhaps 
they were NEVER any good, and that's why our world is the way it is now. 
</p>
<p> 4. Enjoy yourselves! There is never any excuse for being bored . . . or 
boring! </p>
<p> Join us in making the "revolution" a game; a game played for the highest 
stakes of all, but a joyous, carefree game nonetheless! </p>
