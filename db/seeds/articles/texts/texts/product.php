<h1>Product is the  Excrement of Action</h1>
<h6>by Jeanette Winterson </h6> 
<p> <i>Honestly, when was the last time you spent a whole day just enjoying 
what you were doing and feeling? Enjoying it solely for its own sake, 
without thinking about the future or worrying about the long-term consequences? 
When was the last time you spent a whole month living that way? Do you 
have a hard time forgetting about your responsibilities, your goals, your 
productivity, and just being in the present? </i></p>
<p> Today, our lives revolve around things. We measure our worth in terms 
of our material possessions: in terms of our control over things outside 
ourselves. We gauge our success in life in terms of our "productivity"; 
that is, our ability to make these things. Our social system revolves 
around the production and consumption of material goods more than anything 
else. Even when we are not thinking about material objects, we represent 
our lives to ourselves as things: we consider our accomplishments, our 
future prospects, our social position... anything but how we actually 
feel. "The end justifies the means," we say; that is, the products of 
our actions, the end results of our lives, are more important to us than 
the process of living itself. </p>
<p> But products are the excrement of actions. Product is what is left over 
when the dust settles and the pulse returns to normal, when the day is 
done, when the coffin is laid in the ground. We do not exist in the settling 
dust or the scorecard; we are here in the present tense, in the making, 
the doing, the feeling. Just as we try to immortalize ourselves by fleeing 
into the world of fixed, deathless images, we try to externalize ourselves 
by thinking in terms of the results of our actions rather than our experience 
of the actions themselves. After all, it's so complicated to have to worry 
about whether you are really enjoying yourself, how you are feeling in 
the moment. It is easier to focus on the results, the hard evidence of 
your life; these things seem easier to understand, and easier to control. 
</p>
<p> Modern society is centered around the production and distribution of 
material goods, rather than the happiness and satisfaction of its participants. 
thus Modern man thinks of his life in terms of what he has "to show for 
it," rather than considering the life itself. </p>
<p> Of course today's average worker is used to thinking about the ends 
rather than the means. He spends most of his time and energy working at 
a job that in all likelihood does not fulfill his dreams. He looks forward 
to payday every two weeks, for he counts on his paycheck to make sense 
out of his life: without it, he would feel like he was wasting his time. 
If he didn't look at the "consequences" of his actions as a justification 
for them, life would be unbearable-what if he constantly considered how 
he was feeling as he bagged groceries, or asked himself if he was having 
fun every moment he struggled with the fax machine? Insofar as his everyday 
experience of life is tedious and meaningless, he needs to concentrate 
on the coming weekend, the next vacation, his next purchases, to fend 
off insanity. And eventually he is bound to generalize that mode of thinking 
to other parts of his life: he comes to evaluate possible actions according 
to the rewards they offer, just as he would evaluate a job according to 
the wage it offers. </p>
<p> Thus, the present has lost almost all significance for modern man. Instead 
he spends his life always planning for the future: he studies for a diploma, 
rather than for the pleasure of learning; he chooses his job for social 
status, wealth, and "security," rather than for joy; he saves his money 
for big purchases and vacation trips, rather than to buy his way out of 
wage slavery and into full time freedom. When he finds himself experiencing 
profound happiness with another human being, he tries to freeze that moment, 
to turn it into a permanent fixture (a contract), by marrying her. On 
Sundays he goes to church, where he is told to do good deeds in order 
to one day receive eternal salvation (as NietzsChe says, the good Christian 
still wants to be paid well), rather than for the sheer pleasure of helping 
others. The "aristocratic disregard for consequences," that ability to 
act for the sake of action that every hero possesses, is far beyond him. 
</p>
<p> It is a cliche that men and women of middle class and middle age have 
a hard time putting aside their insurance policies and investment programs 
to seize the moment; but, all too often, we, too, end up exchanging present 
for future and experience for souvenirs. We save mementos, trophies, boxes 
of keepsakes, old letters, as if life can be gathered, stored up, frozen 
for later... for later? For when? Life is here with us now, running through 
us like a river; and like a river, it cannot be held in place without 
losing its magic. The more time we spend trying to "save it up," the less 
we have to throw ourselves into it. </p>
<p> The worst of us, in fact, are the radicals and artists. All too often, 
we "revolutionaries" expend our efforts thinking and talking about a revolution 
"that is to come," rather than concentrating on making revolution in the 
present tense. We're so used to thinking in terms of production that even 
when we try to make life into something immediate and exciting, we still 
end up centering our efforts around an event in the future-one that we 
may not even live to see. And like factory supervisors, we worry more 
about our productivity (the number of new believers recruited, the progress 
of the "cause," etc.) than about how we and our fellow human beings are 
feeling and living. Artists suffer from this tendency most of all; for 
their vocation itself depends on making products out of the raw material 
of real-life experience. There is something of the capitalist's lust for 
domination in the way that artists mold their emotions and experiences 
into forms of their own making through the act of expression; for the 
expression of feelings and sensations, unique and unfathomable as they 
are, always consists of a kind of simplification. It isn't enough for 
the artist to just experience and appreciate life as it really is; she 
comes to cannibalize her life for what is really a career, a series of 
products outside herself, even adjusting her life for her career's sake. 
Worse, she may find that she cannot make love on a rooftop at daybreak 
without planning out the excellent scene for her novel (excrement!) that 
this will make for. </p>
<p> Certainly, excretion is a healthy and necessary function of the soul 
as well as the body, and there is a place for art in our lives as a way 
to pour feeling back into the world when the heart is full to overflowing; 
but if you keep trying to do it after it is unnecessary, you eventually 
force out your heart and the rest of your insides (remember the fairy 
tale of the goose and the golden eggs?). We must put life and experience 
first, we must meet the world with only this in mind, as fresh and innocent 
as when we were children, with no intentions to cannibalize, categorize, 
organize, or simplify the profound infinities of our experiences. Otherwise, 
we will miss what is most vital, most beautiful, most immediate in this 
world, in our search for things that can be pressed flat and preserved 
"for all time." Imagination should be used first and foremost to transform 
everyday reality, not just to make symbolic representations of it. How 
many exciting novels could be written about the sort of lives that most 
of us lead these days, anyway?. Let us make living our art, rather than 
seeking to make mere art out of our lives. </p>
<p> If we ever find happiness, it will be in the process of living, of doing 
what we want and living out our dreams, not in the products of our lives. 
If we don't pause and enjoy the present now, when will we? So let's stop 
"making history"-we're all so obsessed with "making a mark"-and start 
living. That would be a real revolution. Let's live for today, for our 
lives, not our "results"! </p>
<p> <i>"Sometimes," said Julia, "I feel the past and the future pressing 
so hard on either side that there's no room for the present at all." "But 
I tell you, Henri, that every moment you steal from the present is a moment 
that you have lost forever. There's only now." </i></p>
