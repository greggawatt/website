<h6>DISPATCH FROM THE CRIMETHINC. CENTRAL COMMITTEE<br />
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:</h6>
<h1>ALL TRAVELER KIDS<br />
PURGED FROM CRIMETHINC. 
MEMBERSHIP</h1>
<p><em>Quitting your job was about having more time to do what 
needs doing, not just isolating yourself from the rest of 
humanity&#8212;wasn&#8217;t it?</em></p>
<p>
<em>If one makes propaganda extolling what is revolutionary 
about shoplifting, one is not necessarily trying to get 
would-be revolutionaries to shoplift so they can be &#8220;more 
revolutionary&#8221; [obviously a stupid approach if there 
ever was one&#8212;although exploring the tactical benefits 
of shoplifting for a class of people looking to do less 
buying might make sense]&#8212;one might instead be trying 
to identify for shoplifters what is already insurrectionary 
in their actions, so they can broaden their analysis of 
their own lives.</em></p><p><em>
Crimethought is not any ideology or value system or lifestyle, 
but rather a way of challenging all ideologies and value 
systems and lifestyles&#8212;and, for the advanced agent, 
a way of making all ideologies, value systems, and lifestyles 
challenging. It is not crimethought just to survive without 
a job by dumpstering, squatting, and hitchhiking; it is 
crimethought to realize that this lifestyle provides resources 
that can be used to revolutionize demonstration activism, 
or underground literature. It is not crimethought simply 
to distribute propaganda attacking the monotony and limited 
options of traditional employment; it is crimethought to 
create situations in which both workers and ex-workers benefit 
from each others&#8217; different experiences, and consequently 
discover new options and new adventures that were previously 
obscured.</em></p>

The Stalinists, Surrealists, Situationists, and even Southern 
Baptists all had their bloody purges and internal dissensions, 
so why can&#8217;t we, too? Having no membership should 
be no obstacle: we can still hold exclusions from time to 
time, just to be sure everyone remembers. These are festive 
occasions for us weathered politicos, analagous to the subtextual 
backbiting at the dinner parties of the bourgeoisie or the 
witch trials in the Salem, Massachusetts of old. But first, 
before we get into the firey self-righteousness of the thing, 
some background.</p><p>
It&#8217;s been nearly a year now since I went through my 
entire proofing copy of the <em>Evasion</em> book in the 
dark back seat of a Greyhound traveling by night, with only 
my trendy activist headlamp for light. Even then, we knew 
already what the greatest drawback of publishing it in book 
form would be: all the general ideas in <em>Days of War, 
Nights of Love</em>, the inspirations and analyses and especially 
the rhetoric calculated to encourage revolt, would now be 
summed up in some minds by the specific formula spelled 
out by the stories in this new book. Even though <em>Evasion</em> 
is not a work of political theory, or a prescription of 
tactics, but clearly a personal account, a memoir&#8212;even 
though we&#8217;ve mantained from the beginning that there 
is no single strategy for insurgency, but that everyone 
must invent and reinvent their own&#8212;it was inevitable 
that we would be misunderstood by some, and we accepted 
that in publishing the book.</p><p>
In publishing it, we wanted&#8212;to articulate this for 
the thousandth and last time&#8212;to introduce an account 
(one of many) of work-free living to a wider readership, 
and thus challenge conventional notions about the sanctity 
of property and the misery of material poverty. With this 
cultural warfare, we hoped to do our part to expand the 
anticapitalist movement. Sharing particular scams, extoling 
the lifestyle of the scam artist, these were secondary goals 
at best. The &#8216;zine had already been produced and distributed 
on as massive a scale as the infrastructure of our d.i.y. 
underground allowed, to the demographics who would be most 
likely to utilize its scams and emulate the author&#8217;s 
life choices; we printed the book version to see if this 
narrative of refusal and adventure could sow other seeds 
outside its native environment. Some of the feedback we&#8217;ve 
received from beyond the existing activist and anarchist 
communities suggests that it has; but now it&#8217;s time 
to shake off whatever success we&#8217;ve achieved, as one 
must always do to make space for new attempts.</p><p>
And to speak, for the last time as well, of how our efforts, 
with this book and other projects, have been misunderstood. 
There is a certain kind of reader who, though you do your 
best to bring out the subtleties and ironies, will always 
focus on the most superficial, controversial terms in your 
works, and interpret your complex critiques as simple dismissals 
and endorsements (&#8220;paying=bad,&#8221; &#8220;shoplifting=good&#8221;&#8212;or, 
far worse, &#8220;=anticapitalist&#8221;). Whether he professes 
to be your adversary or accomplice, it is best to avoid 
him altogether, for he will lower the level of dialogue 
on any issue to his own low denominator&#8212;and at that 
elevation, little of value can be discussed or achieved. 
Perhaps we can be blamed, in part, for creating some of 
these readers, by producing material that was too simplistic 
or too complex; perhaps this kind of reader is simply too 
rampant today to be altogether avoided by even the nimblest 
of propagandist&#8217;s pens. One certainly can&#8217;t 
say enough, though, that nothing in the world is one-dimensional.</p><p>
So while this, too, has been said a million times, perhaps 
it will do some good to say it again in this context: the 
traveler kid lifestyle is not in itself at all revolutionary. 
It may surprise some to hear this from us&#8212;that shows 
how little they&#8217;ve been listening all along. Shoplifting, 
hitchhiking, scamming, unemployment&#8212;separated from 
a program of life- and world-transformation, all these are 
merely alternative tools for survival, a survival which 
makes do with and ultimately accepts the status quo. Yes, 
it <em>is</em> better, however infinitesimally, to steal 
products than to give money to our executioners&#8212;but 
it&#8217;s not enough! Three millenia of shoplifting now, 
and the exchange economy is still thriving. If it&#8217;s 
life we&#8217;re after, not mere survival, as the old dichotomy 
goes, we can&#8217;t just sit tight now in our squats and 
punkhouses, eating dumpstered bagels and selling our shoplifted 
wares on e-bay; we have to keep on risking everything to 
challenge the system that denies us the <em>rest</em> of 
the world, if for nothing else at least to continue challenging 
ourselves.</p><p>
For the record, and to briskly repudiate every imbecile 
who has used &#8220;CrimethInc.&#8221; as a synonym for 
scamming and freeloading, we&#8217;ve never been interested 
in being or being seen as partisans of any lifestyle; we&#8217;ve 
always insisted that being radical involves subverting all 
possible lifestyle choices, all traditional strategies and 
identities. Revolution occurs when some part of the social 
equation changes: when apolitical workers initiate a wildcat 
strike, when middle-aged mothers start to show up in the 
black bloc beside their sons and daughters, when vagabond 
dropouts integrate themselves into local struggles for affordable 
housing. The letters we receive from adult secretaries who 
have used CrimethInc. literature to inspire themselves to 
change their lives are infinitely more encouraging to me 
than the scores of teenagers reading<em> Harbinger</em> 
as they set out on the hitchhiking excursions young folks 
always have. Not that there is anything wrong with being 
a hitchhiking teenager&#8212;but to be a <em>dangerous</em> 
hitchhiking teenager, you must do something more than simply 
hitchhike, and interpreting anticapitalist texts as glorifications 
of your hitchhiking doesn&#8217;t count.</p><p>
I hopped my very first train just a few weeks ago, after 
nearly eight straight years of unemployment and anticapitalist 
agitation. For most of that time, I was never much of a 
hitch-hiking, train-hopping, scam-pulling traveler kid, 
and neither were most of the individuals I collaborated 
with&#8212;there are, believe it or not, a wide variety 
of other lifestyles that are equally conducive to such endeavors. 
The historical intersection of the latest wave of youth 
nomadism with the propaganda groups like ours have been 
spreading is, in some ways, unfortunate; it has had some 
good effects, but it has also made it easier for people 
to dismiss some radical ideas as the alibis of a new youth 
trend&#8212;or, worse, to believe that they are being radical 
simply by joining such a trend!</p><p>
The creation of subcultural ghettos, the reinterpretation 
of subversive acts as promotions of some alternative lifestyle&#8212;these 
are processes by which opposition and subversion have been 
repeatedly neutralized over the past four decades, if not 
centuries. Yes, it is critical that we build new communities, 
with new cultural values and approaches, and that we not 
belittle these as &#8220;mere subcultures&#8221; when they 
do arise&#8212;for it is in these communities that we can 
develop and sustain a resistance, and create a context in 
which to lead free lives. It is also critical that we keep 
challenging these communities, that they do not become stagnant 
or self-satisfied: for as long as we are all under the great 
thumb, freedom is always for all or none.</p><p>
CrimethInc., and for that matter (and far more important) 
crimethink, are not membership organizations, anyway. Subverting 
is not something you <em>are</em>, it&#8217;s something 
you <em>do</em>, and must find new ways to do in every attempt. 
Let&#8217;s not rest at expelling the traveler kids&#8212;hell, 
we&#8217;re <em>all </em>expelled, time-tested CrimethInc. 
agents first and foremost! Even the most experienced of 
us insurrectionists must start from scratch every morning 
to foment insurrection, shaking off the inertia of the past 
to see anew what the current context calls for. When we 
succeed in doing this, we can change the world, for it is 
inertia above all that keeps the wheels spinning as they 
do. If we cannot, we are done for&#8212;we will be more 
anachronists than anarchists, and our activism mere retroactivism.</p><p>
And so now we turn away from the past, from all explanations 
and justifications and apologies, to face the future and 
the experiments we have in store for it. Doubtless, they 
will occasion comparable storms of controversy and misconception, 
if we are ambitious enough to keep pushing our own limits 
and hazarding schemes crazy enough to work. So, all would-be 
crimethinkers are hereby expelled from CrimethInc.&#8212;whoever 
can discover the strategies for the next offensive, set 
the terms for the next infectious revolts and heated debates 
and social upheavals, let them claim it for themselves! 
Expect our next book, or one of them, to be a liberation 
manual for middle-aged mothers, not another youth&#8217;s 
chronicle of wilful indigence. In the meantime, let&#8217;s 
us traveler kids stop congratulating ourselves on how free 
we are and start using that word, <em>free</em>, as a verb, 
not an adjective. </p>
