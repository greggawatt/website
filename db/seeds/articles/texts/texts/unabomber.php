<h1>The Unabomber:</h1>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0px">&nbsp;A Hero For Our Time</h2> 
<p> Pop quiz: what is it called when one of the finest 
minds of a generation picks a few individuals who are personally involved 
in the destruction of the environment (a timber-industry lobbyist) or 
of the attention span and reasoning ability of tens of thousands of Americans 
(an advertising executive), and kills or maims them in the pursuit of 
finding a voice for his concerns about social issues . . . concerns that 
otherwise would be heard by very few? Clearly, it is murder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> And what is it called when a nation of overweight 
barbers and underpaid clerks, of lazy unemployed middle class intellectuals 
and talk-show-educated housewives, of cowardly fast-food-chin managers 
and racist sorority girls, conspires to execute this murderer in the name 
of protecting the glorious status quo from his obviously deranged "mad 
bombings"? </p>
<p> The death penalty. And rightly applied, too, in 
defense of the right of forest clear-cutters and professional liars to 
continue bending our world to their vision without the danger of being 
molested by those who prefer redwood forests to Quik-Marts and sonnets 
to detergent slogans. </p>
<p> Seriously, and rhetoric aside, what is the difference 
between the two situations? In one case, a single person evaluates his 
situation and decides upon a course of action he feels is right. In the 
other case, millions of people, who are not very used to making up their 
minds by themselves, feel strong enough all together to strike out blindly 
against an individual who does not remain within their boundaries of acceptable 
behavior. </p>
<p> Now, our gentle and moderate reader would no doubt 
like to object that it is not fear of the free-standing individual that 
prompts the outcry against this terrorist, but moral indignation&#151;for he 
has taken "innocent" life in his quest to have his ideas heard, and that 
is wrong in every situation. </p>
<p> But this nation of petty imbeciles is not regularly 
outraged about the taking of innocent life: as long as it fits within 
the parameters of the status quo, they don't care at all. </p>
<p> How many more people than the Unabomber have tobacco 
companies maimed and killed, by using advertising to addict them at a 
very young and uninformed age to an extremely harmful drug? How about 
the companies that advertise and sell cheap liquor in impoverished neighborhoods 
filled with alcoholics? How many citizens of third world nations have 
suffered and died at the hands of governments supported by such corporations 
as Pepsi Co., or even by the U.S. government itself? And how much animal 
life is destroyed thoughtlessly every year, every day in death camp factory 
farms... or in ecological destruction brought about by such companies 
as Exxon (our reader will remember the Valdez) or McDonalds (one of the 
better known destroyers of the rainforest)? No one is particularly concerned 
about these abuses of "innocent" life. </p>
<p> And indeed, it is harder to be, for they are institutionalized 
within the social and economic system... "normal." Besides, it is hard 
to figure out who exactly is responsible for them, for they are the results 
of the workings of complicated bureaucracies. </p>
<p> On the other hand, when one individual attempts 
to make his criticism of these destructive systems heard by the only really 
effective means, it is easy to pick him out and string him up. And our 
hypocritical outrage about his wrongdoings compared those of our own social 
institutions shows that it is his ability to act upon his own conclusions 
that truly shocks and frightens us most of all. </p>
<p> Our fear of the Unabomber as a freely acting individual 
shows in the attempts our media has made to demonize him. Details of his 
life, such as his academic achievements and his ability to live a Thoreauan 
self-sufficient existence, that would normally occasion praise, are now 
used to demonstrate that he is a maladjusted freak. Random and unimportant 
details of his life, similar to details of any of our lives, such as failed 
love affairs and childhood illnesses, are used to explain his "insane 
behavior." In speaking thus, the press suggests that there is no question 
at all that his actions were the result of insanity, pulling away in terror 
from the very thought that he might be just as rational as they. Newspapers 
print the most arbitrary and disconnected excerpts of his manifesto that 
they can combine, and they describe the manifesto as being random and 
disconnected&#151;they even describe it as "ramblings" with a straight face, 
despite the well-known short attention span of today's media. </p>
<p> But it is not necessary that we accept the media's 
typical over-simplification of the case. The Unabomber's manifesto has, 
as a result of his efforts, been published and widely distributed. We 
can all read it for ourselves, not just in disconnected excerpts, but 
in its entirety, and decide for ourselves what we think of his ideas. 
</p>
<p> Do not be frightened by the Unabomber's willingness 
to stand out from the crowds and take whatever actions he believes are 
necessary to achieve his goals. In a civilization so stricken with mindless 
submission to social norms and irrational rules his example should be 
refreshing rather than horrifying; for his worst crimes are no worse than 
ours, in being citizens of this nation... and his greatest deeds as a 
dedicated and intelligent individual far outshine those of most of our 
heroes, who are for the most part basketball players and cookie-cutter 
pop musicians anyway. </p>
<p> At least, given the chance as we are, we should 
read his manifesto and come to our own conclusions, rather than allowing 
the press and popular opinion/paranoia to decide for us. </p>
