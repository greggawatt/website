<h1>Forget Terrorism</h1>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0px">The Hijacking of Reality</h2>
<p><em>A 
person who has a sense that her life is meaningful and her 
destiny is in her hands is in fundamental ways more alive 
than a person who does not. In that sense, on September 
11, terrorists used airplanes to kill thousands of people, 
and politicians and media used the event to kill a little 
bit of everyone who survived.</em></p>
<p> 
Here&#8217;s one of those rare stories that gets the same 
spin from both the corporate and the independent media: 
there was a brief window of time between November 1999 and 
September 2001 when the most fundamental conflict in theworld 
was between power and people. Up until the Berlin wall fell 
<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('History is rife with ironic coincidences, not the least of which being that the Berlin wall fell on 11/9.', CAPTION, '[1]');" onmouseout="nd();">[1]</a>, 
it had been between capitalism and communism; now, as everyone 
knows, it&#8217;s between terrorism and so-called democracy. 
But for that brief, exhilarating period, the primary dichotomy 
in more and more people&#8217;s minds was between hierarchy 
and domination on the one hand and autonomy, liberty, and 
cooperation on the other.</p>
<p> 
Everywhere across the planet, people were starting to organize 
themselves, testing their hands at self-directed activities 
and pushing back when state and corporate interests tried 
to interfere. As summits of the economic elite were shut 
down, local collectives assembled, and global networks of 
resistance linked up, it began to feel like the future was 
up for grabs. But no one on either side of the barricades 
had factored in the unsettled accounts U.S. foreign policy 
had wrought in the third world, and everything changed the 
day terrorists, directed by a former employee of the C.I.A., 
brought those chickens home to roost in New York City.</p>
<p> 
Everyone knows the unutterable tragedy that occurred that 
morning, when thousands of human beings lost their lives 
in an act of cold-blooded violence. But another tragedy, 
a stranger, subtler one, compounded the first: the tragedy 
that occurs in this society when a large number of people 
have the misfortune of losing their lives live on international 
television.</p>
<p> 
An interesting side effect of the events of September 11 
was that television news ratings shot through the roof. 
<em>Everyone</em> was glued to the television: and all conversations, 
in every city, state, and nation, were about New York City. 
Suddenly&#8212;because what one thinks about is one&#8217;s 
reality&#8212;New York City, and more specifically the attack 
and deaths, were the <em>epicenter</em> of reality, and 
the zones radiating outward from it were less and less real. 
The most a man in Iowa could hope for was to have a family 
member in the towers, so he could be connected by blood 
to the things that mattered. That, of course, is an insensitive 
overstatement&#8212;but let&#8217;s not deny that some of 
us who didn&#8217;t have such a relative felt a twinge of 
secret, perhaps subconscious jealousy of those who did, 
who could speak with such anguish and outrage about the 
one and only subject on anyone&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p> 
In the same way that serial killers and serial dramas, disaster 
movies and real disasters command attention, so did New 
York City: and everyone outside the city was paralyzed, 
looking on from a distance, wondering what would happen 
next as one does in a movie theater. We were all powerless, 
our sense of agency gone at the most urgent of times. Those 
of us who opposed corporate media and otherwise refused 
to be complicit in our own passivity still stared at the 
screen with everyone else; those who did not have such an 
analysis watched and accepted the conclusions of the talking 
heads as if they were their own. Later, doing as they were 
told, they raised a flag that was not their own, either.</p>
<p> 
So-called &#8220;activists&#8221; were among the ones <em>most</em> 
paralyzed, comparatively speaking. Those who had shared 
a sense that they could change the world now froze up as 
if hypnotized. This was certainly convenient for the powers 
that be, who scripted the coverage and spin of the tragedy&#8212;but 
why did this happen?</p>
<p> 
If you want to disable people, make them feel insignificant. 
Feeling insignificant paralyzes; without morale and momentum, 
all the power in the world&#8212;and remember, that power 
is made up of the assembled powers of all individuals, it 
is not some scepter wielded from above&#8212;can only be 
applied accidentally, according to the dictates of the few 
whose sense of entitlement is reinforced by their titles 
and television exposure. Feelings of insignificance render 
insignificant; desperation to be &#8220;where the action 
is&#8221; replaces the ability to decide for oneself <em>what</em> 
the action should be.</p>
<p> 
The underlying message of the news, the implication hammered 
deeper home with every replay of the towers collapsing, 
was that whatever we little people did, world history, and 
therefore real life, was out of our hands. The trivial little 
games activists and communities had been playing were irrelevant; 
no one would pay attention any longer, let alone join in. 
This was not necessarily true, of course. But 
it was news because it was on the news, and because it was 
news it made itself true.<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('This shows how much we&#8217;ll have to learn about being able to ignore the media, if we are to build a sustainable liberation movement.', CAPTION, '[2]');" onmouseout="nd();">[2]</a></p>
<p> 
Ironically, this displacement of meaning&#8212;this centering 
of attention upon New York City as the global nucleus of 
meaning itself&#8212;was exactly what had outraged and baited 
the terrorists. But striking back at the heart of the empire 
with the same violence they had learned from it, they simply 
fed the beast&#8212;for whether you suffer it or apply it, 
terrorism is the ultimate spectator sport, and spectatorship 
can only consolidate power in the hands of the ones who 
direct the spotlight.</p>
<p> 
Those towers were not just a locus of financial power, but 
even more so of iconographic power&#8212;the most valuable 
currency in this information age. How is that kind of power 
gathered and reproduced? In the same way financial capital 
is gathered and reproduced: moguls centralize and monopolize 
it by impoverishing others of the sense that their life 
has meaning, thus forcing them to buy in to their mass-produced 
meanings. For example: people in small town America watch 
television instead of talking with each other, just as indigenous 
peoples outside the U.S. seek sweatshop employment, because 
it seems to be the only game town. This isn&#8217;t natural&#8212;for 
the mass-manufactured alternatives to appear desirable, 
those television watchers have to have lost the intimate 
connections and ongoing projects that would have brought 
them together off their couches, just as the natives have 
to have had their traditional lifeways destroyed by conquistadors. 
Disneyland is as fun as Des Moines is dull, just as Michael 
Jordan is as rich as a Nike sweatshop worker is poor&#8212;these 
are not coincidences. Economic exploitation and media domination 
are essentially the same process, carried out on different 
levels.</p>
<p> 
So in terms of the war for sense of self that has gone on 
between us and mass media for generations now, September 
11th, 2001 saw an act of superlative terrorism carried out 
against every one of us: not just in the hijacking and crashing 
of the planes, but in the way the event was used to hijack 
and crash the budding sense that we could determine reality 
for ourselves. This consolidated power in the hands of the 
U.S. government, among others, who used it to 
further paralyze and distract people by starting a series 
of controversial wars.<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('As Hitler said, if you want to keep soldiers from stopping to think for themselves, keep your armies marching&#8212;and that goes for liberal protesters as well as army recruits.', CAPTION, '[3]');" onmouseout="nd();">[3]</a> 
In a time when the hierarchical elite was anxious to come 
up with a new false dichotomy to distract everyone from 
the fundamental struggle between power and people, nothing 
could have been more opportune.</p>
<p> 
The question, now&#8212;the ultimate question, on which 
all life hinges&#8212;is how we can once more reframe the 
terms of this conflict. It is not a question merely of peace 
versus war: the decade of &#8220;peace&#8221; that led up 
to the September 11 attacks was sufficiently bloody to persuade 
a generation of suicide bombers that it was worth dying 
to get revenge on the West, and a new peace under the current 
conditions would be even more treacherous. Nor can we cast 
this as a conflict between ideologies: we cannot afford 
to be armchair quarterbacks any longer, backing our favored 
teams or themes against others while bullets and bombs rain 
randomly into the stands. The question is&#8212;always is, 
no matter who is dying or killing, no matter what is said 
on television&#8212;what we can do ourselves, what we make 
of our lives, how each of us interacts with global events 
in our daily decisions. Our opponents are those who would 
hinder our efforts and obscure this question for their own 
ends, who would rather rule over a world of passive spectators 
wracked by terror and war than take a place among equals 
acting to correct the injustices that provide justifications 
for politicians and terrorists alike.</p>
<p> 
Everyone knows, if it were up to us there would be no more 
wars, no more exploitation, no more terrorism.<em> It is 
up to us.</em></p>
