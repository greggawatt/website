<h1>Bringing the Heat in Miami</h1>
<h5>An Analysis of Direct Action<br />
at the Nov. 
2003 F.T.A.A. Ministerial</h5>
<h3>VICTORY BEFORE WE EVEN HIT THE STREETS</h3><p>
It was almost a miracle, not to mention a victory for our 
movement, that the mobilization in Miami happened at all. 
Miami was one of the most repressive police states North 
America has ever witnessed; the $8.5 million security plan, 
funded by federal anti-terrorism dollars, fortified an already 
incredibly brutal police force. In the days leading up to 
the event, paramilitary police stood guard on every downtown 
corner, arresting anyone who looked like they might be a 
protester. The media engaged in a smear campaign of lies 
and slander about anarchists, lionizing the police force 
that was to protect the city from these invading beasts. 
Plans for the protest seemed to grow murkier rather than 
clearer as the event approached. Many expected the worst.</p>
<p>Not 
to be deterred, anarchists entered a city with no infrastructure 
for direct action and set one up in a mere few weeks. The 
convergence and welcome centers, the legal, medical, and 
food support, the independent media and art spaces&#8212;these 
expressions of mutual aid, solidarity, and gift economics 
were living examples of the world we are fighting for. This 
infrastructure, pulled together in such a short period of 
time, was comparable to analogous structures that have taken 
months and even years to set up in cities that regularly 
host mobilizations. Our ability to put down such roots in 
the face of such repression is a moving example of the strength 
of our movement.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>WE 
ARE EVERYWHERE</h3><p>
On Thursday afternoon, as a mass of activists were beating 
a spirited retreat from the police line to the sound of 
marching drums and whistles, a legal observer turned to 
face his comrades. &#8220;As your legal observer, I advise 
you to&#8230;&#8221; he began, echoing the familiar words 
of many a legal observer before him, &#8220;&#8230;pull 
shit into the middle of the street and set it on fire!!&#8221; 
Cheering ensued all around.</p>
<p>This 
anecdote foregrounds a marked difference in our movement 
today from the atmosphere of even three years ago, when 
direct action tactics such as property destruction were 
extremely controversial. Many of the liberals who claimed 
we were going to wreck &#8220;their&#8221; movement with 
our confrontational approaches are gone&#8212;they&#8217;ve 
joined us or disappeared. And the new people who have gotten 
involved have, in large part, done so because they are attracted 
to the opportunity to confront power, rather than merely 
beseech it.</p>
<p> The 
mainstream media kept referring to an elusive minority of 
&#8220;bad&#8221; or &#8220;violent&#8221; protestors, the 
so-called &#8220;self-described anarchists&#8221;&#8212;as 
if there was any other kind! But make no mistake about it&#8212;besides 
the Root Cause and union marches, Miami was largely an anarchist 
mobilization. The entire infrastructure described above, 
including the convergence center, planning framework, and 
Indymedia coverage, was organized on decentralized anarchist 
principles. Nearly everyone involved was indeed a &#8220;self-described 
anarchist.&#8221; Even many of the N.G.O. employees in Miami 
were closeted anarchists! And not only that: people and 
press mobbed a forum in Lake Worth called &#8220;A New World 
in Our Hearts,&#8221; to hear about anarchy from anarchists 
themselves&#8212;and some of the attendees were inspired 
to offer assistance, or even join the protests themselves.</p>
<p> This 
is not to say that we anarchists are not still struggling 
with internal problems&#8212;with sensitivities to race, 
class, and gender, for example, which groups like Anarchist 
People of Color brought to the forefront. One manifestation 
of this was discrimination against older people or people 
perceived, especially by the security crew, to be &#8220;normal,&#8221; 
i.e. from outside the anarchist community proper. In one 
episode which almost beggars belief, a group of long-time 
anarchist organizers who had dressed in civilian clothes 
to avoid police attention were set upon by some other activists 
who attempted to force them to give them their food! If 
we dismiss, alienate, or immediately suspect people who 
look and dress differently than the stereotypical black-hooded 
anarchist, we will piss off our most valuable allies&#8212;and 
many anarchists as well!</p>
<p> On 
the other hand, there were some remarkable bridges built 
across demographic lines. One of the best examples of this 
took place on Tuesday, November 18, when some anarchists 
typically associated with the Black Bloc got together for 
a ritual with the Pagan Cluster. Words cannot describe the 
feelings of solidarity and love experienced by these two 
groups, groups many would have written off as incompatible: 
singing, dancing, drumming, raging, and continuing an alliance 
built in the front-lines of earlier street battles, we wove 
a web that knit our communities together to be stronger 
and more inclusive. The black and gold bracelets that were 
shared that night could be seen on many a wrist over the 
following days, an uplifting affirmation of common cause 
and courage in the face of adversity.</p>
<h3>SUPPORT 
FROM UNEXPECTED PLACES</h3>
<p>Presumably, one of the reasons the powers that be picked 
Miami to host the negotiations for the Free Trade Area of 
the Americas was the ostensible absence of an anarchist 
community. All sorts of rumors went around in advance about 
how the locals were all going to be hostile to us, would 
perhaps even attack us. The discovery we made upon arriving 
in Miami&#8212;that not everyone there is a pro-capitalist 
Cuban refugee, that there are people everywhere who are 
suffering under the heel of the corporate class and know 
it&#8212;should be a reminder not to get carried away by 
our own alarmism in the future. In countless experiences 
with locals, we received heartfelt support and encouragement. 
Most people don&#8217;t believe everything they see on television, 
nor do they appreciate their neighborhoods being overrun 
by belligerent police officers&#8212;nor do they believe 
corporate capitalism offers us the best of all possible 
worlds.</p>
<p> The 
police and media spent months and millions spreading the 
lie that small family-run businesses in downtown Miami would 
be destroyed in an orgy of anarchist violence. In an effort 
organized from the convergence center the week before the 
days of action, many activists visited businesses with letters 
of solidarity explaining anarchist ideas, the content of 
the proposed F.T.A.A., and what to expect from the upcoming 
demonstrations&#8212;not to recruit, but to give people 
an idea of why the protests were taking place. Most welcomed 
these activists with open arms, glad to hear what they had 
suspected all along to be police hype dispelled by the protesters 
themselves. One person working at a local business said 
she had enough papers and letters from the police on the 
upcoming protests to start a fire&#8212;and she just might! 
In support, some shops even gave protestors free food or 
offered their stores as havens to those wishing to escape 
the police. Outreach efforts like these are powerful direct 
actions themselves, not to mention examples of successful 
acts of resistance in a city suffering such vicious police 
occupation that just walking downtown put individuals at 
risk of arrest.</p>
<h3>DIRECT 
ACTION PLANNING</h3><p>
Despite all the pressure and police intimidation tactics, 
or perhaps even partly owing to the ambience they created, 
there was an incredible energy among activists in Miami 
in the days leading up to the F.T.A.A. ministerial. The 
convergence space was buzzing with activity; spokescouncil 
meetings were held every night to plan for the actions. 
The spokescouncil meetings focused on a direct action framework 
for what was to be the main day of action, Thursday, November 
20, as well as a jail solidarity plan, preparations for 
smaller actions throughout the duration of the convergence, 
and general logistics for the convergence space itself.</p>
<p> Arriving 
in Miami, everyone wanted to know what the direct action 
plan was. As a large percentage of those participating in 
the actions came from far away, much of the organizing was 
done in a decentralized fashion. Consultas were held regionally 
throughout the U.S.; affinity groups and clusters made plans 
to implement when they arrived. In the months leading up 
to the event, it really seemed like people were coming with 
tight, organized plans to contribute to a larger collective 
action. Early the preceding summer, the plan for a Padded 
Bloc emerged, and organizers in Pittsburgh announced that 
a large number of people equipped with armor and shields 
would be ready to defend areas from police. This plan didn&#8217;t 
actually materialize. Word of this plan helped to build 
momentum as people prepared for the protests, but it also 
spread the illusion that more people planned to attend than 
actually did, and that people were more prepared then they 
ended up being.</p>
<p> What 
happened in the end was far less organized than many expected. 
In conference calls and a consulta in Gainesville, a small 
working group was formed to plan a structure for direct 
action. This group planned a very basic framework that relied 
heavily on the independent planning of those who were to 
participate in it; but it seemed that the plan was not clear 
enough for many to know how to plug into it, even if they 
were prepared to do so in the first place. A 7 a.m. gathering 
was planned at Government Center a few blocks from the fence 
surrounding the hotel where the summit was taking place. 
The idea was that people would rally and then march towards 
the fence to carry out actions to &#8220;bring down the 
fence and shut down the F.T.A.A. meetings.&#8221;</p>
<p> In 
an attempt to placate the A.F.L.-C.I.O., there was an agreement 
made at the spokescouncil meetings that the direct action 
would stay clear of the intersection of Flagler and Biscayne 
between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m., the hours when the union march 
was to take place. Some felt that this decision was forced 
through without regard for the perspectives of many activists. 
Flagler and Biscayne is the main intersection in downtown 
Miami; it was the area outside the fence closest to the 
F.T.A.A. meeting site, and it ended up being the only place 
close to the fence that was accessible. This plan disregarded 
the rules of thumb that have helped to make direct action 
successful in the past: it meant that direct action activists 
would be alone out on the streets, with no permitted areas 
or safe zones to retreat to. Essentially, agreeing to a 
separate time of day for direct action offered the police 
a perfect excuse to brutalize and arrest everyone on the 
streets of downtown Miami outside the hours of the permitted 
march.</p>
<p> Naturally, 
this situation scared off many people who were uncertain 
about participating in direct action; it also gave the police 
a justification for picking people off before they got to 
the action, or at least blocking them out. These considerations 
may explain why the turnout for direct action in Miami was 
so much lower than expected&#8212;in the end, it was not 
so much the intimidation of the police as a lack of concrete 
and convincing preparation on our part that discouraged 
more people from joining in. </p>
<p> This 
submissiveness to the wishes of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. hierarchy 
compromised the times and places of the direct action while 
gaining little except empty words of &#8220;solidarity&#8221; 
from the union officials. After months of frustrating negotiations 
with them, representatives of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. hierarchy 
were still being introduced as &#8220;allies&#8221; by facilitators 
and certain others at spokescouncil meetings. We anarchists 
can choose our own allies, thank you very much; we should 
not unquestionably accept such loaded terms as descriptions 
of organizations that have done little in the past to warrant 
being called allies. And, not surprisingly, while affinity 
groups of rank and file union members did join the protesters 
in the streets, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. hierarchy urged union 
members to flee the protests into their buses as soon as 
their permitted march ended.</p>
<p> Ultimately, 
this &#8220;direct action free&#8221; period during the 
main hours of the protest reinforced separation between 
members of unions and direct action activists, a separation 
that must be destroyed for both our sakes. Yes, it is important 
not to provoke unnecessary conflicts, but when representatives 
of a hierarchical organization that has a history of selling 
out workers&#8217; struggles inform us that the best way 
we direct action activists can show solidarity with them 
is by not engaging in direct action&#8230; well, even if 
a spokescouncil of anarchists decides to honor their request, 
that shouldn&#8217;t prevent the rest of us from making 
up our own minds about the issue responsibly, and being 
prepared to do the organizing to make another approach possible 
if we deem it worthwhile.</p>
<h3>IF 
YOU ATTACK ONE OF US, YOU ATTACK ALL OF US</h3><p>
Despite all these factors, the protesters made the best 
of their situation. At the last minute, a section of the 
Black Bloc decided to meet at the Convergence Center, many 
blocks away from the fence, where it was felt they could 
at least marshal a whole bloc to defend themselves, and 
travel into downtown side by side with puppeteers and foreign 
media for safety; but the puppeteers with automobiles, and 
most of the media, ended up driving to downtown, leaving 
them isolated on foot. For a time, this bloc march had the 
advantage of surprise, and it took a few minutes for the 
police to mobilize to block their route; but after a scuffle 
the bloc was contained, and attempted negotiations with 
the police only resulted in the bloc being contained again 
and brutally attacked with tasers and clubs. Ultimately, 
the group was forced to disperse, and some were arrested.</p>
<p> The 
larger group of protesters met as planned in Government 
Center at a peaceful rally, and then marched to the fence. 
Once there, a single grappling hook was successfully thrown 
and hooked on the &#8220;anarchist-proof&#8221; fence&#8212;and 
it did wobble! But as the Padded Bloc didn&#8217;t end up 
coming together, the police were able to attack an essentially 
undefended crowd. They attacked mercilessly with concussion 
grenades and rubber bullets, and charged peaceful and dancing 
protesters with their clubs and batons, brutally beating 
many. Heroic defenses were staged, bottles thrown, but little 
could be done in the face of such overwhelming attack.</p>
<p> A 
couple hours later, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. march took off. Many 
protesters tried to join, but were stopped at first by the 
A.F.L.-C.I.O. marshals, who only much later let the protesters 
in. Even inside the march, some protesters were attacked 
by police, and though steelworkers&#8212;not marshals!&#8212;came 
to their rescue, a few were arrested. At the conclusion 
of the march, new conflicts began with the police, that 
proved to be some of the most dramatic and exciting of the 
day&#8230; yet even then, the overwhelming force of the 
police ultimately forced us to split apart and flee to safety. 
Protesters were attacked by police wielding batons, tear 
gas and pepper spray and other chemical agents, and rubber, 
wooden, and plastic bullets. Over one hundred protestors 
were treated for injuries; quite a few were hospitalized&#8212;one 
with a bits of a police bullet in his head! Small groups 
leaving the protests were also targeted by police. </p>
<p> 
As people regrouped themselves, it was clear that the protest 
was neither a failure nor a success. It was far from a victory&#8212;many 
of us were wounded and bleeding, others in jail. The fence 
was not taken down and we had not had the numbers or militancy 
that we had hoped for. But it was a show of strength and 
courage that we assembled that day in the heart of the world&#8217;s 
most well-defended police-state, and survived.<br>
</p>
<h3>WHAT 
DID WORK: <br />
Building Alliances, Putting Down Roots, and Taking 
Aim</h3>
<p> 
Outside the haze of tear gas and robo-cops wielding guns 
and batons, there were many successful aspects of the Miami 
mobilization against the F.T.A.A., and it&#8217;s important 
that these efforts aren&#8217;t obscured by all the discussion 
of police brutality. Here are a few:</p>
<p> -Free 
housing, free food, free legal and free medical support 
was provided by and for thousands of people throughout the 
mobilization. Talk about workable alternatives to capitalism!</p>
<p> -The 
Green and Eco-Bloc set up a community garden in Overtown, 
and distributed cherry trees throughout the neighborhood 
as well as sharing gardening skills and other resources 
that will be of lasting value.</p>
<p> -Hundreds 
of people participated in the Root Cause march, which crossed 
the thirty four miles from Fort Lauderdale to Miami, one 
mile for every country involved in the F.T.A.A. discussions. 
The march connected important struggles in South Florida 
to the F.T.A.A. and brought out the ways that poor communities 
and people of color in the region are already being affected 
by &#8220;free&#8221; trade. Many alliances were built and 
strengthened between those who took part in this march.</p>
<p> -Six 
weeks before the F.T.A.A. ministerial, the anarchists in 
the Lake Worth Global Justice Group organized the Free Carnival 
Area of the Americas (F.C.A.A.) in Lake Worth, Florida, 
about one hour north of Miami. The F.C.A.A. opened a warehouse 
to provide space for puppet and art making, planning meetings 
and workshops, and other preparations for protests against 
the F.T.A.A. They put out a call for activists to join them 
in this effort in the weeks before the F.T.A.A. ministerial. 
The art and puppets were used in the Root Cause march and 
the direct actions in Miami, and the activist infrastructure 
in Lake Worth contributed in other crucial ways to the mobilization. 
Many other inspiring and successful events occurred under 
the umbrella of the Free Carnival Area of the Americas, 
too.</p>
<p> -Both 
prior to the main days of action and after, anarchists in 
South Florida organized three press conferences and public 
forums. One of these events, entitled &#8220;A New World 
in Our Hearts,&#8221; was held in Lake Worth a week before 
the main days of action. It attracted large numbers of people 
from the Lake Worth community and helped to get many involved 
in organizing and playing other supportive roles, such as 
providing much-needed housing for activists arriving from 
out of town. </p>
<p> -A 
couple affinity groups working together compiled and distributed 
packets including posters, wheatpaste, stickers, annotated 
maps, and similar redecorating tools to dozens of other 
groups and individuals. Several crews covered various Miami 
neighborhoods with messages of resistance to the F.T.A.A. 
in the nights before the main day of action. These groups 
went entirely unnoticed by the police, and put up a massive 
amount of posters and graffiti in neighborhoods whose only 
source of information on the F.T.A.A. might otherwise have 
been the corporate news media.</p>
<p> -Autonomous 
direct actions&#8230; One can guess that many affinity groups 
organized covert actions in Miami that have not been widely 
publicized. A communiqu&eacute; on Indymedia announced that 
multiple military recruiting centers had suffered property 
destruction. Rumors have circulated about other similar 
actions. The powers that be have made a point of keeping 
silent about all such activities, of course, and from this 
we can deduce that they regard them as a genuine threat 
which must not be encouraged by any free publicity.</p>
<p> 
-&#8220;The Really Really Free Market&#8221; took place 
on the day after the main actions. Hundreds participated 
in setting up this working example of a gift economy in 
action. Groups set up blankets and booths providing free 
stuff from food, art, literature, and music to massages, 
new banner dropping methods, funny hats, and healing circles. 
This action highlighted our alternatives to &#8220;free&#8221; 
trade and capitalism, and showed examples of how human beings 
can provide for one another through mutual aid.</p>
<h3>MIAMI 
SCORECARD: <br />
What we did, what we didn&#8217;t do, what we 
learned . . .</h3> 
<p>Before 
we conclude, let&#8217;s review some of the goals we have 
to choose from whenever we engage in mass direct action:</p>
<p> a. 
costing our enemies money and otherwise interfering with 
their misdeeds</p>
<p> b. 
enjoying the liberating experience of taking on the powers 
that be and winning</p>
<p> c. 
revealing the capitalist state for what it is by provoking 
police repression</p>
<p> d. 
learning how to act and apply power in anti-authoritarian 
masses</p>
<p> e. 
communicating with &#8220;the world&#8221; through mass 
media </p>
<p> f. 
communicating with locals about the issues</p>
<p> All 
these goals were achieved in Seattle, when we had the element 
of surprise on our side, and some of them were in Miami&#8212;though 
more of them could have been, had we been better prepared 
for the approaches we attempted, and augmented them with 
other tactics. Attacking the fence, in the presence of such 
a police mobilization, was perfect for provoking police 
repression, obviously; it was also moderately good for learning 
how to act in anti-authoritarian masses, though the police 
presence discouraged many from attending and interfered 
with our ability to work together freely. We were able to 
attract some mass media coverage, for those who value that, 
though it was mostly along the spectrum that runs between 
&#8220;Murderous Anarchists Hope to Destroy City&#8221; 
and &#8220;Harmless Protesters Brutalized by Police,&#8221; 
which at best only portrays us as victims and frightens 
people away from future protests; the massive police presence 
prevented us from doing anything that could have really 
grabbed worldwide attention on the news, let alone invested 
others with a sense of their own limitless power. The goal 
of interacting with locals was achieved in part before and 
after the main demonstration by those who took the time 
to go around and do so&#8212;though we can always stand 
to do better there. Among other things, a more concerted, 
extensive effort to get graffiti and posters up around the 
area would have avoided the risks posed by police in the 
occupied zone, while demonstrating our power and omnipresence 
and thus raising morale.</p>
<p> As 
for the goal of actually striking effectively against the 
powers that be&#8230; considering the massive police presence 
around the fence, this would have been better achieved by 
small groups operating outside the centers of police occupation, 
targeting corporate property and infrastructures efficiently 
and stealthily. Had such plans been widely deployed and 
successful, they would have achieved many goals: they would 
have sent a stern message to both Miami and the world that 
hosting such contemptible events will result in great costs; 
they would have provided a new model for others in the anti-capitalist 
movement to try out themselves, as the older models become 
obsolete in the face of new police tactics; our enemies 
would have to consider widening the areas and methods of 
police surveillance next time, which would cost them more 
money, frustrate more citizens, and generally add to their 
already acute overextension. The drawback to such covert 
activity is that, unlike mass activity, it must be invitation-only, 
and thus doesn&#8217;t lend itself to movement-building 
or skill-sharing; the main reason to go to a mass action 
rather than staying home blowing up banks is to have the 
opportunity to work with many others in collective projects 
that anyone can join in. On the other hand, many among us 
prefer the covert model as a matter of personal taste, plenty 
of us know each other well enough to arrange such activities 
together, and it&#8217;s no secret that some of our more 
experienced folks didn&#8217;t participate in actions in 
Miami because the overtly planned activities seemed suicidal 
and no covertly planned activities seemed to be in the works. 
</p>
<p> So 
what did we need in Miami that we didn&#8217;t have? We 
should have had more clandestine planning sessions, for 
one thing. Direct action should not be planned like civil 
disobedience; in order for it to be safe, to elicit the 
confidence it needs to succeed, and to be unpredictable 
enough to stand a chance of working, it has to be arranged 
among friends. No organizing any massive spokescouncil can 
do could compensate for the lack of private initiative and 
planning, if affinity groups don&#8217;t prepare effectively 
amongst themselves. More of us should have been forthcoming 
with our own ideas: even those of us already known for our 
resourcefulness often hesitate to come forward and actually 
organize something, feeling that someone else must already 
be doing it or that it must already be too late&#8212;but 
all too often it turns out that no one else is working on 
the things we&#8217;d like to see happen, and we find out 
after it really is too late that the ideas we&#8217;d had 
would have worked out perfectly if only they had been tried. 
Frequently we end up doing at the last minute what we should 
have had the confidence to do ahead of time. If we&#8217;re 
going to have to organize groups and lay plans anyway, we 
might as well get over our fear of doing these wrong and 
just go ahead and try.</p>
<p> Ultimately, 
if an effective resistance is to be mounted, all the forces 
in a protest have to work together. This means everybody&#8212;from 
rank and file workers, puppeteers, and black-clad anarchists, 
to dancing Pagans and locals from Overton&#8212;everybody 
has to find a way to contribute to what others are doing, 
to complement others&#8217; projects without obstructing 
or endangering them. The long, steady process of building 
this cooperation can&#8217;t be bypassed by communicating 
with hierarchies. A single representative from the management 
of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is a poor substitute for actual communication 
with union workers. No amount of anti-racist workshops could 
possibly substitute for the experience of interacting with 
people of different economic and racial backgrounds. Many 
of the problems with the protest resulted from people&#8217;s 
over-reliance on the spokescouncil to provide some master 
plan that would magically coordinate the whole movement. 
Of course we need to coordinate in order to work together, 
but that isn&#8217;t going to happen if we sit around waiting 
for orders at a spokescouncil meeting. We can do this inside 
and outside the spokescouncil meeting, months before protest, 
in private as well as in more public meetings. Every affinity 
group should come to town with a hundred secret plans to 
stop the F.T.A.A. single handedly, as well as ideas they 
can share with other groups.</p>
<p> But, 
to repeat this once more, with the full brunt of the forces 
of the terror war being brought to bear against us in Timoney&#8217;s 
Miami it was a wonder, albeit a symbolic one, that a single 
grappling hook reached the fence at all. If the more confrontational 
among us could have wrought more havoc there, it would have 
done much to discredit the idea that a militarized force 
of any size can succeed in dominating a decentralized, flexible 
gathering of freedom-hungry people; all the same, what we 
did just by being there at all was impressive and important&#8212;and 
maybe enough. </p>
<p> The 
difficult time we had in Miami is going to occasion much 
discussion of tactics at future demonstrations, but perhaps 
that focus is misplaced. Shutting down such meetings was 
always a symbolic goal, remember, even when it was possible 
by such straightforward means. Now that the government has 
to spend eight and a half million dollars every time a ministerial 
takes place, and not only paralyze the city but also terrorize 
its inhabitants, it might be that they&#8217;re doing our 
work for us: the once-secret meetings are impossible to 
keep out of the public eye, the &#8220;free&#8221; trade 
they concern is associated with massive police repression 
and suspension of human rights, and there are more opportunities 
than ever for us to bring up our alternative. All we have 
to do is show up, cause them enough consternation that they&#8217;ll 
have to make the same preparations for the next one, and 
get away without unsustainable losses.</p>
<p> Let&#8217;s 
be realistic, anyway: although there are improvements we 
could have made in our strategizing for mass activity in 
downtown Miami&#8212;we could have gotten more militant 
people to the fence at once Thursday morning, or turned 
the retreat from it that afternoon into a forward march 
that was routed to pass by corporate targets, to name two 
examples&#8212;there&#8217;s only so much we can accomplish 
under such intensive surveillance and repression. But the 
fact that they had to spend over eight million dollars to 
achieve this is a sign of their weakness, not of their strength&#8212;they 
sure can&#8217;t do that everywhere, all the time. It&#8217;s 
taken them four years since we won in Seattle to fully develop 
their anti-Seattle security system, and by now we should 
be ready to move on to the next unexpected line of attack. 
We&#8217;ve learned so much about mass activity in the training 
ground these summits have provided us&#8212;now we should 
take those lessons back to the unguarded environments in 
which such tactics first thrived. Next time we succeed in 
coming together in great numbers without the police state 
getting wind of it in advance, it&#8217;s going to be spectacular. 
Let&#8217;s start focusing our energy on how to get people 
together for mass action outside the context of international 
trade meetings&#8212;let&#8217;s call our own days of action 
proactively, organize surprise group activities in our own 
communities, even hijack crowded events and turn them into 
mass actions. That&#8217;s the future: more unanticipated 
covert activity at mass action demonstrations, more unanticipated 
mass actions in other settings!</p>
<p> So 
what&#8217;s next? For starters, let&#8217;s not forget 
to support all the people who were arrested in Miami, especially 
the ones with felony charges. They need both emotional support 
and assistance with legal costs, and we need to provide 
these in abundance so others will not be afraid to take 
similar risks in the future. And above all, let&#8217;s 
not neglect the work in our own communities that generates 
the social foundation from which these efforts grow. Now 
is the time to start new infoshops, new outreach programs, 
even new anarcho-punk bands. Let&#8217;s plan for the next 
massive demonstration such as the G8 in Georgia this June, 
or the Republican National Convention in New York City&#8212;just 
to be there to keep the heat on them without killing ourselves 
or getting all of us in jail, to keep them focused on protecting 
themselves from that angle so they won&#8217;t see what&#8217;s 
coming at them from the other side&#8230; and perhaps, also, 
to try out some new ideas, to show off how much more creative 
and powerful and dangerous than them we are.</p>

<h3>Postscript: 
One Activist&#8217;s Perspective on
<br />
RACE RELATIONS IN THE HEAT OF THE MIAMI PROTESTS</h3>
<p>The 
neighborhood closest to the main action was an African-American 
ghetto, blasted and impoverished. Not everyone there was 
thrilled to have us around at first; walking and riding 
around Overtown before the demonstrations, we sometimes 
heard locals shout out taunts to the effect of &#8220;let&#8217;s 
here it for free trade!&#8221; This didn&#8217;t seem to 
be an expression of political or economic principles, but 
rather of resentment against the predominantly white outsiders 
who were invading their space&#8212;it probably hasn&#8217;t 
boded well in the past when a bunch of white folks showed 
up in Overtown.</p>
<p> All 
the same, considering what we learned later about the misinformation 
the police had spread there, the locals were really patient 
with us in the days leading up to the action. After all 
the chaos was all over and we had made some friends in the 
area, an older man wearing a black power t-shirt confided 
in us that the police had put the word around Overtown in 
advance that people there were encouraged to rob and beat 
up activists&#8212;not only would the police turn a blind 
eye, but it might even improve their relations with the 
community. Our friend explained that no one there trusted 
the police, or followed their instructions. All the same, 
given the bad impression of white folks in general that 
it&#8217;s safe to suppose many in Overtown have, they were 
generous not to take advantage of the opportunity to try 
to redistribute a little wealth.</p>
<p> Encouraging 
locals to assault activists was not the only way our enemies 
rolled out the red carpet for us. The first time I walked 
through Overtown, I was approached by a small crowd of children 
who asked me how much I was getting paid. This was perplexing 
to me. I answered that as I had been unemployed since 1994, 
I wasn&#8217;t getting paid anything. They persisted in 
asking the question, until I finally answered that the last 
time I was getting paid, I&#8217;d been getting five dollars 
an hour, under the table. Satisfied, they went away; but 
I heard this question over and over, and I soon figured 
out what it meant: the rumor had been spread thoroughly 
that we protesters were being paid to protest. For folks 
who live in dire poverty and have to deal with police harassment 
constantly, it would make sense to conclude that white folks 
who presumably have an easier time getting work and wouldn&#8217;t 
otherwise be on the receiving end of so much police attention 
must be doing it for some financial incentive; but the rumor 
was so widely disseminated that it couldn&#8217;t have just 
been a hypothesis somebody came up with. In my opinion, 
it must have been spread in advance as disinformation. It 
certainly made us look less like crusaders for global justice 
and potential allies in the struggle, that at first everyone 
who saw us thought we were there gentrifying their neighborhood 
on salary.</p>
<p> All 
these strikes against us notwithstanding, the attitudes 
of Overtown residents towards us changed dramatically as 
soon as we were in open conflict with the police. As we 
retreated into Overtown ahead of the police onslaught Thursday 
afternoon, everyone we passed cheered us on&#8212;most people 
had come out onto the street to see what was going on, and 
now that they saw we shared a common enemy with them, one 
who was attacking us as if we were a real threat, they embraced 
us as friends. Several people I briefly spoke with encouraged 
us to step up our level of confrontation with the police&#8212;the 
implications were that if we could escalate the conflict, 
they would join in. That makes sense&#8212;though they have 
every reason to revolt, people who suffer poverty and constant 
police repression already are not going to engage in an 
uprising unless it looks like it is going to work. For a 
moment that afternoon, I could imagine what would happen 
if we somehow were able to hold our ground against the police 
and create a space for the residents of Overtown to join 
in. That happened in Quebec&#8212;I remember a local throwing 
a snowball at the riot police there a couple hours before 
all the locals joined in showering the cops with projectiles, 
just as a man in Overtown was seen throwing a football at 
the pigs in his neighborhood that afternoon&#8212;it can 
happen anywhere people are angry, if resistance can reach 
critical mass.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, 
we were fleeing in disarray and desperation from the most 
militarized police force North America has ever seen, in 
no condition for touching off the sequel to the L.A. riots 
of 1992. The most we could hope for was to get out of the 
situation without concussions or handcuffing scars. Before 
we&#8217;d arrived at the inhabited areas of Overtown, we&#8217;d 
been pulling dumpsters and other obstacles into the street 
to slow the police advance; encouraged by the support we 
were receiving, we decided to ask around how people on the 
street felt about us doing that there. Everyone said they 
felt fine about it; two of us began pushing another dumpster 
into the middle of the road.</p>
<p> At 
that point, out of nowhere, a large black man wearing a 
jacket with an American flag on the back came charging up 
at us, screaming and waving a two by four. I managed to 
get between him and my friends and defuse things enough 
for all of us to get away with only superficial injuries, 
but the important thing was that we had miscalculated our 
place in the situation. Looking around at the people who 
had just given us the go-ahead, I saw them shaking their 
heads at the guy who was attacking us, but also withdrawing 
some of their unconditional permission for us to be there 
fighting the police now that it was causing internal strife 
in their community.</p>
<p> That 
experience was a reminder that although folks who are really 
suffering under capitalism don&#8217;t have reason to trust 
us as allies until we are actively challenging its power, 
we also have to be careful in the process not to make things 
any more difficult for them than they are. They didn&#8217;t 
mind the police chasing us into their neighborhood, by and 
large&#8212;the police were going to be there anyway, and 
it was a relief that they were there pursuing white folks 
for once, rather than locals; but when our interactions 
with them resulted in drama among the residents, that was 
a problem. It also drove home the point that you can&#8217;t 
consider the opinions of any demographic in one bloc; everyone 
we&#8217;d talked to was in favor of us making barricades, 
but that didn&#8217;t mean &#8220;the people of Overtown&#8221; 
were in favor of it, it just meant certain ones were. Whenever 
people of one background try to consider the perspectives 
of people from another&#8212;especially when white activists 
do so, I&#8217;m afraid&#8212;it is all too easy to summarize 
and oversimplify.</p>
<p> That 
episode passed quickly, but by then we were surrounded&#8212;police 
on all the streets around us. We ran down an alley, only 
to see with dismay that they had closed off the street ahead 
of us too. In a matter of seconds, a full line of police 
cars blocked every street around us from corner to corner, 
and police on foot were arresting every activist in range. 
We hunkered down in the alley, trying quixotically to hide 
between the scattered weeds at the foot of a chain-link 
fence, a veritable lightshow of blue and red reflecting 
off the brick wall facing us. A helicopter swooped low overhead. 
It seemed it was all over.</p>
<p> At 
this moment, just as we were trying most desperately to 
will ourselves invisible, a couple local kids came into 
the alley and walked up to us, hands in their sweatshirt 
pockets as if they were pretending to hold guns with which 
to rob us. They quickly abandoned this half-hearted charade, 
however, and started asking us questions about what we were 
doing. At first, of course, we had to explain that we weren&#8217;t 
being paid to protest&#8212;something that I&#8217;m sure 
was becoming clearer by the second anyway. Then we explained&#8212;succinctly, 
and not without a little impatience lest our new friends&#8217; 
presence attract the attention of our riot-armored foes&#8212;what 
we were doing there, and asked their advice as to how we 
could extricate ourselves from the situation. There wasn&#8217;t 
much they could tell us&#8212;being completely surrounded 
in foreign territory by thousands of armored police whose 
specific goal is to beat and incarcerate you is a toughie 
however you look at it. Eventually they wished us luck and 
moved on.</p>
<p> We 
spent a tense hour and a half in that alley, waiting for 
the sun to go down and the police lines to break up so we 
could make a dash for safety. Long after darkness had fallen, 
the lights were still flashing all around us, and police 
still marching past both mouths of the alley, and the helicopter 
was still overhead, now scanning the alley with its spotlight. 
Those were some tense minutes for all of us&#8212;except 
the member of our party who had spent an entire sleepless 
week volunteering at the convergence center, who actually 
took advantage of the situation to nod off for a while! 
The only explanation I can come up with for why they never 
came into the alley to arrest us is that, for the whole 
duration of the protests, the police never moved in groups 
of fewer than thirty, and in that &#8220;dangerous&#8221; 
neighborhood they feared to break up their numbers to pick 
off stragglers. I recount this story here in case it may 
be useful to others trying to escape under similar circumstances 
one day&#8212;heaven help us, such circumstances are getting 
more and more common.</p>
<p> Finally 
the police forces moved on, and we made our way out onto 
the street two at a time, without any incriminating material, 
in the cutest boy-girl couples we were able to throw together 
(these work for getting through police lines, I swear&#8212;hold 
hands, look deep into each other&#8217;s eyes a lot, focus 
on seeming harmless&#8212;earlier that day a companion and 
I had penetrated the police defenses as far as the front 
door of the hotel hosting the ministerial, thanks to our 
lovebirds masquerade). There we found locals waiting to 
guide us to safety, freely telling us where the police lines 
were now and offering to lead us down the safest routes. 
Trapped inside police lines, fearing almost for our lives, 
nothing could have been sweeter mercy than this. Thanks 
in no small part to their help; we arrived back safe at 
the convergence center an hour later, grateful to be free 
and alive.</p>
<p> Our 
guides, of course, inquired if we had any money, and we 
penniless anti-capitalists scrounged in our pockets to see 
if there was any leftover subway change to share. I emphasized 
to one of them that there was no price that could be placed 
on such assistance, and she let me know she would have done 
it for free, needless to say, as she wanted the same things 
we wanted. All the same, the situation&#8212;basically paying 
a native guide to lead us out of a dangerous situation, 
as if we were in wartime Morocco or something&#8212;was 
a reminder of how much economic inequality there still is 
even between people on the outside of the capitalist system. 
What I&#8217;d give to live to see a day when the means 
she has access to and the means I have access to are no 
different, to never have to wonder again to what extent 
I&#8217;m being regarded as a potential source of income 
rather than a fellow human being!</p>
<p> That&#8217;s 
what we&#8217;re fighting for, when we contest our enemies&#8217; 
free trade conventions and economic power in general. Next 
time we need to make it clearer to locals in advance what 
we&#8217;re trying to do, so we won&#8217;t have quite as 
much misinformation and misunderstandings to cut through 
to find common ground. If we can get a full-scale anarchist 
insurrection going in any city in this empire, there are 
millions who will join in, who need it even worse than we 
do&#8212;but we have to work towards this conscientiously, 
with an acute awareness of the challenges other communities 
face, and in constant dialogue as to what our role in the 
larger struggle should be.</p>
<p> I&#8217;ll 
conclude with the letter some friends distributed in Overtown 
after the demonstrations were over. Good for them&#8212;let&#8217;s 
see more of that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4> An 
open letter to the residents of Overtown from some F.T.A.A. 
protestors:</h4>
<p> Thank 
You Very Much!</p>
<p> Over 
the last week there were times when anti-F.T.A.A. protestors 
were pushed into Overtown by the police. We want people 
to know:</p>
<p> 1) 
We had no intention to bring any heat into your neighborhood. 
In fact, many of us talked about the need to not do that.</p>
<p> 2) 
We very much appreciate all the help and moral support we 
received from hundreds of residents.</p>
<p> 3) 
We understand that the police brutality we experienced is 
just a small slice of what poor people of color deal with 
everyday. We recognize this system is racist. We are dedicated 
to smashing racism and the system behind it.</p>
<p> 4) 
We oppose the F.T.A.A. because it is an attempt by the rich 
to exert even more control over all of our lives. It is 
also the continuation of the colonial relationships that 
have been enslaving, killing and stealing land for over 
500 years.</p>
<p> 5) 
We know there are a lot more problems than the F.T.A.A. 
We are against the entire greedy corporate-military-police-war 
machine that oppresses life. We are for community empowerment, 
self-determination, justice and total liberation. ALL POWER 
TO THE PEOPLE!</p>
