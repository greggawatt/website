<h2 style="margin-top: 0px">The Discreet Charm of the</h2>
<h1>Bourgeoisie</h1>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0px">or, The Tyranny of the Hair Dryer</h2>
<h6>[adapted from George Orwell's Homage to Catatonia]</h6> 
<p> Does your father drift from one hobby to another, fruitlessly seeking 
a meaningful way to spend the little "leisure time" he gets off from work? 
Does your mother endlessly redecorate the house, going from one room to 
the next until she can start over at the beginning again? Do you agonize 
constantly over your future, as if there was some kind of track laid out 
ahead you&#151;and the world would end if you turned off of it? If the answer 
to these questions is yes, it sounds like you're in the clutches of the 
bourgeoisie, the last barbarians on earth. </p>
<h3>The Martial Law of Public Opinion</h3>
<p> Public opinion is an absolute value to the bourgeois man and woman because 
they know they are living in a herd: a herd of scared animals, that will 
turn on anyone it doesn't recognize as its own. They shiver in fear as 
they ponder what "the neighbors" will think of their son's new hairstyle. 
They plot ways to seem even more normal than their friends and coworkers. 
They don't dare fail to turn on their lawn sprinklers or dress appropriately 
for "casual Fridays" at the office. Anything that could drag them out 
of their routines is viewed as suspect at best. Love and lust are both 
diseases, possibly fatal, as are all the other passions that could drive 
one to do things that would result in expulsion from the flock. Keep them 
quarantined to secret affairs and teenage dates, to night clubs and strip 
clubs&#151;for God's sake, don't contaminate the rest of us. Go wild when "your" 
football team wins a game, drink yourself into oblivion when the weekend 
comes, rent obscene movies if you have to, but don't you dare sing or 
run or make love out here. Under no circumstances admit to feeling anything 
that doesn't belong in the staff room or at the dinner party. Under no 
conditions admit to wanting anything more or different than what "everyone 
else" wants, whatever and whoever that might be. </p>
<p> And of course their children have learned this, too. Even after the 
death matches of the grade school nightmare, even among the most rebellious 
and radical of the nonconformists, the same rules are in place: don't 
confuse anybody as to where you stand. Don't use the wrong signifiers 
or subscribe to the wrong codes. Don't dance when you're supposed to be 
posing, don't speak when you're supposed to be dancing, don't mess with 
the genre or the moves. Make sure you have enough money to participate 
in the various rituals. To keep your identity intact, make it clear which 
subcultures and styles you're aligned to, which bands and fashions and 
politics you want to be associated with. You wouldn't dare risk your identity, 
would you? That's your character armor, your only protection against certain 
death at the hands of your friends. Without an identity, without borders 
to define the edges of your self, you'd just dissolve into the void . . .
wouldn't you? </p>
<h3>The Generation Gap</h3>
<p> The older generations of the bourgeoisie have nothing to offer the younger 
ones because they have nothing in the first place. All their standards 
are hollow, all of their riches are consolation prizes, not one of their 
values contains any reference to real joy or fulfillment. Their children 
sense this, and rebel accordingly, whenever they can get away with it. 
The ones that don't have already been beaten into terrified submission. 
</p>
<p> So how has bourgeois society continued to perpetuate itself through 
so many generations? By absorbing this rebellion as a part of the natural 
life cycle. Because every child rebels as soon as she is old enough to 
have a sense of self at all, this rebellion is presented as an integral 
part of adolescence&#151;and thus the woman who wants to continue her rebellion 
into adulthood is made to feel that she is insisting on remaining a child 
forever. It's worth pointing out that a brief survey of other cultures 
and peoples will reveal that this "adolescent rebellion" is not inevitable 
or "natural." </p>
<p> This perpetual rebellion of the youth also creates deep gulfs between 
different generations of the bourgeoisie, which play a crucial role in 
maintaining the existence of the bourgeoisie as such. Because the adults 
always seem to be the enforcers of the status quo, and the youth do not 
have the perspective yet to see that their rebellion has also been absorbed 
into that status quo, generation after generation of young people are 
able to make the mistake of identifying older people themselves as the 
source of their misfortunes rather than realizing that these misfortunes 
are the result of a larger system of misery. They grow older and become 
bourgeois adults themselves, unable to recognize that they are merely 
replacing their former enemies, and still unable to bridge the so-called 
generation gap to learn from people of other age groups... let alone establish 
some kind of unified resistance with them. Thus the different generations 
of the bourgeoisie, while seemingly fighting amongst themselves, work 
together harmoniously as components of the larger social machine to ensure 
maximum alienation for all. </p>
<h3>The Myth of the Mainstream</h3>
<p> The bourgeois man depends upon the existence of a mythical mainstream 
to justify his way of life. He needs this mainstream because his social 
instincts are skewed in the same way his conception of democracy is: he 
thinks that whatever the majority is, wants, does, must be right. Nothing 
could be more terrifying to him than this new development, which he is 
beginning to sense today: that there no longer is a majority, if there 
ever was. </p>
<p> Our society is so fragmented, so diverse, that at this point it is absurd 
to speak of a "mainstream." This is a myth partly created by the anonymity 
of our cities. Almost everyone one passes on the street is a stranger: 
one mentally relegates these anonymous figures to the faceless mass one 
calls the mainstream, to which one attributes whatever properties one 
thinks of strangers as possessing (for the smug salesman, they all envy 
him for being even more respectable than they are; for the insecure bohemian 
rebel, they must disapprove of him for not being like they all are). They 
must be part of the silent majority, that invisible force that makes everything 
the way it is; one assumes that they are the same "normal people" seen 
in television commercials. But the fact is, of course, that those commercials 
refer to an unattainable ideal, in order to keep everyone feeling left 
out and insufficient. The "mainstream" is analogous to this ideal, as 
it keeps everyone in line without ever actually making an appearance, 
and possesses the same degree of reality as the perfect family in the 
toothpaste advertisement. </p>
<p> No one worries more about this absent mass than the bohemian children 
of the bourgeoisie. They bicker over how to orchestrate their protests 
to gain "mass appeal" for their radical ideas, as if there still was a 
mass to appeal to! Their society is now made up of many communities, and 
the only question is which communities they should approach... and dressing 
"nice," proper language and all, is probably not the best way to appeal 
to the most potentially revolutionary elements of their society. In the 
last analysis, the so-called "mainstream" audience most of them imagine 
they are dressing up for at their demonstrations and political events 
is probably just the spectre of their bourgeois parents, engraved deep 
in their collective subconscious as a symbol of the adolescent insecurity 
and guilt they never got over. They would do better to cut their ties 
to the bourgeoisie entirely by feeling free to act, look, and speak in 
whatever ways are pleasurable, no matter who is watching&#151;even when they 
are trying to advance some political cause: for no political objective 
reached by activists in camouflage could be more important than beginning 
the struggle towards a world in which people will not have to disguise 
themselves to be taken seriously. </p>
<p> This is not to pardon those insecure bohemians who use their activism 
not as a means of building ties with others, but rather as a way to set 
themselves apart: in their desperation to purchase an identity for themselves, 
they believe they must pay for it by defining themselves against others. 
You can recognize them by their self-righteousness, their pompous show 
of ideological certainty, the ostentatious way they declare themselves 
"activists" at every opportunity. Political "activism" is almost exclusively 
their sphere, today, and "exclusive" is the key word... until this changes, 
the world will not. </p>
<h3>Marriage . . . and Other Substitutes for Love and Community</h3>
<p> Reproduction is a big issue for the bourgeois man and woman. They can 
only have children under very precise circumstances; anything else is 
"irresponsible," "unwise," "a poor decision for the future." They must 
be prepared to give up every last vestige of their youthful, selfish freedom 
to have children, for the mobility their corporations demand and the strain 
of vicious competition have destroyed the community network that long 
ago used to share the labor of child-rearing. Now every family unit is 
a tiny military outpost, closed and locked to the outside world both in 
their hearts and in the paranoia-turned-city-planning of their suburbs, 
each one an isolated emotional economy to itself where scarcity is the 
key word. The father and mother must abandon their selves for the prescribed 
roles of care-giver and bread-winner, for in the bourgeois world there 
is no other way to provide for the child. Thus the bourgeois couple's 
own fertility has been made a threat to their freedom, and a natural part 
of human life has become a social control mechanism. </p>
<p> Marriage and the "nuclear family" (the atomized family?) as chain gang 
have survived as a result of this calamity, much to the misfortune of 
potential lovers everywhere. For as the young adventurer, who keeps her 
lusts strong and her appetite whetted with constant danger and solitude, 
knows well, love and sexual desire cannot survive overexposure&#151;especially 
in the dull and lifeless settings that most married partners share time. 
The bourgeois husband sees the only lover he is permitted under only the 
worst possible circumstances: after every other force in his world has 
had the chance to exhaust and infuriate him for the day. The bourgeois 
wife learns to punish and ignore as "unrealistic" and "impractical" her 
every desire for romance, spontaneity, wonder. Together, they live in 
a hell of unfulfillment. What they need is a real community of caring 
people around them, so parenthood would not force them into unwanted "respectability," 
so they would still be free to have the individual adventures they need 
to keep their time together sweet, so they would never find themselves 
so lost and desperately lonely. </p>
<p> In just the same way, their steady supply of food, of conveniences, 
comforts, and diversions avail them not. For as every hitchhiker, every 
hero, every terrorist knows, these things gain their value through their 
absence, and can offer real joy only as luxuries happened upon in the 
pursuit of something greater. Constant access to sex, food, warmth, and 
shelter desensitize a man to the very pleasures they afford. The bourgeois 
man has given up his chance to pursue real stakes in life for the assurance 
that he will have these amenities and securities; but without real stakes 
in his life, these can offer him no more real joy than the company of 
his fellow prisoners. </p>
<h3>The Joys of Surrogate Living!</h3> 
<p> You can take a quick tour of all the unacted desires of the bourgeois 
man just by turning on his television or stepping into one of his movie 
theaters. He spends as much of his time as he can in these various virtual 
realities because he instinctively feels that they can offer him more 
excitement and satisfaction than the real world. The saddest part is that, 
so long as he remains bourgeois, this may actually be true. And as long 
as he accepts the displacement of his desires into the marketplace by 
paying for imitations of their fulfillment, he will be trapped in the 
empty role that is himself. </p>
<p> These desires are not always pretty to see played out in Technicolor 
and SurroundSound: the bourgeois man's dreams and appetites are as infected 
by the fetishization of power and control as his society is. The closest 
he seems to be able to offer to an expression of free, liberated desire 
is the fantasy of all-consuming destruction that appears again and again 
at the black heart of his wildest cinematic fever dreams. This makes sense 
enough&#151;after all, in a world of nothing but strip malls and theme parks, 
what honest thing is there to do but destroy? </p>
<p> The bourgeois man is not equipped to view his desires as anything but 
unfortunate weaknesses to be fended off with placebos because his life 
has never been about the pursuit of pleasure&#151;he has spent several centuries 
achieving higher and higher standards of survival at the cost of everything 
else. Tonight he sits in his living room surrounded by computers, can 
openers, radar detectors, home entertainment systems, novelty ties, microwave 
dinners, and cellular phones, with no idea what went wrong. </p>
<p> The bourgeois man is only possible by virtue of the blinders he wears 
that prevent him from imagining that any other way of life is possible. 
As far as he can tell, everyone from the impoverished migrant workers 
of his own nation to the monks of Tibet would be bourgeois too, if only 
they could afford it. He does his damnedest to maintain these illusions; 
without them, he would have to face the fact that he has thrown his life 
away for nothing. </p>
<p> The bourgeois man is not an individual. He is not a real person (although 
if he was, he would probably live in Connecticut). He is a cancer inside 
all of us. He can now be cured. </p>
