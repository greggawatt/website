<h3> Why We Can&#146;t All Just Get Along</h3>
<p> Can we get along? Even for those of us who would prefer to be hermits, 
there is no question today more important than this one&#151;the fate 
of our species and planet will be decided by it.</p>
<p> There is no shortcut around this dilemma. Any kind of capital-R Revolution, 
any redistribution of wealth and power, will be short-lived and irrelevant 
without a fundamental change in our relationships&#151;for social structure 
is an expression of these relationships, not a factor external to them. 
Revolution, then, is not a single moment, but a way of living: anarchy 
and hierarchy always coexist in varying proportions, and the important 
question is simply which you foster in your own life.</p>
<p> We are ill-qualified to reconstruct human relations if we can&#146;t 
even get along with each other in the attempt&#151;and nothing seems to 
create dissension and division like those attempts. Often it seems that 
the people who know least how to relate to others are the self-professed 
activists who set out to save them. Yet these conflicts are not an inescapable 
consequence of human nature, but rather a pattern of cause and effect&#151;which 
can and must be altered. This is a starting place to consider what the 
challenges are in undertaking this, and why we&#146;ve had such a hard 
time to date.</p>
<h3> The Scarcity Economy of Self</h3>
<p> In a world where free, creative action is hard to get away with, we 
all feel impoverished, cheated of the experiences and sensations we know 
should be ours. We compensate as best we can, and often this compensation 
serves only to preserve our destitution. We seek status in wealth, power, 
strength, beauty, reputation, anything to soften the blows of wasted days. 
We compensate by seeking another kind of status, too: the feeling of being 
superior, a status in our own heads.</p>
<p> We live in a society that teaches there is not enough of any valuable 
resource to go around, including selfhood. People on television or in 
books are held up as more important, more noble, more attractive than 
the rest of us. We grow up in households where our parents don&#146;t 
have enough time for us; we are sent to schools that employ a grading 
system that permits only a handful to excel, and are discharged into a 
market that enriches a few of us while exploiting or discarding the rest. 
We internalize the values of this system. We become used to judging our 
value by what we are &#147;better than.&#148; We rush to despise others, 
their plans and ideas and habits and beliefs, in order to reassure ourselves 
that we have worth of our own. When we should be looking for what is positive 
in everything, we denounce and criticize instead&#151;just to reassure 
ourselves! The most insecure among us are not even able to enjoy movies 
and music, because it is so important to them that they have &#147;refined&#148; 
tastes; they don&#146;t realize that when they succeed in failing to enjoy 
something, no one has lost more than they. If you&#146;re going to get 
anything out of any movie or song or interaction (so as not to have simply 
wasted time!), you have to take responsibility for finding ways to enjoy 
and benefit from it.</p>
<p> In its advanced stages, such hypercritical status-seeking can combine 
with a spectator mentality: from a distance, the critic passively votes 
for or against the efforts of others, unable to discern that such things 
as art, activism, community are entirely what he makes of them&#151;and 
that he must make something of them himself in order to get anything out 
of them. This spectatorship reinforces the sense that everything everyone 
else is doing is uninteresting or unintelligent, and thus the feeling 
of superiority the spectator so desperately needs. You rarely encounter 
a genuinely active, involved person who feels the need to proclaim her 
actions superior to others&#146;; but in the spectator&#146;s scarcity 
economy of self, any expression of selfhood, even the most generous and 
positive, can be interpreted as an encroachment, an attack<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib(' The other expression of this same affliction is hero worship, in which one projects all the qualities one finds admirable onto others. This is similarly crippling, of course, and inevitably leads back to the same hostility and scornfor the only thing you can do with individuals or groups you have put on a pedestal is knock them off.', CAPTION, '[1]');" onmouseout="nd();">[1]</a>. 
Every achievement is something to rebel against, assail, deride&#151;as 
if we don&#146;t all feel worthless, abused, hunted enough already!</p>
<p> Those of us who would oppose this scarcity system often have additional 
challenges to face in unlearning its conditioning. Many of us have come 
to this resistance from a place of conflict and struggle, and this sense 
of struggle is still imprinted upon the way we approach all our activities. 
Having been abused, neglected, harassed, having had to fight peers, parents, 
teachers, bosses, police to establish ourselves, we see selfhood as something 
that is obtained by fighting. We come to think of being radical as a war&#151;hence 
the more wars we fight, the more radical we must be. We profess intentions 
to create peace, but the only tools we possess are weapons. Small wonder 
we end up fighting among ourselves.</p>
<h5> <i>&#147;With a little hard work, <br />
you can make yourself feel alienated 
by anything.&#148; </i></h5>
<h3>Justice and Judgment</h3>
<p> Scarcity thinking and the destructive insecurity it fosters have played 
a large part in shaping our notions of justice<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('The self-righteous activists sense of justice is derived from the same origins as the justice system which feeds todays prison-industrial complex: a Christianity that emphasized individual responsibility over the cause and effect of social conditions, in order to invent, advertise, and sell the ultimate scarce commoditysalvation. In a state of truly mutually-beneficial social relations, such threats as incarceration and hellfire would be unnecessarythe threat of expulsion from the community would be dismaying enough.', CAPTION, '[2]');" onmouseout="nd();">[2]</a>. 
Passing judgment can be the ultimate compensation for one&#146;s own shortcomings. 
It&#146;s easy to get self-righteous about someone else&#146;s mistakes, 
flaws, inconsistencies . . . for we all have them, and the more focused 
we are on the shortcomings of others, the less we have to think about 
our own. Witch-hunters who believe that they have found a real live criminal 
(or racist, lifestyle anarchist, class traitor, etc.), just like the ones 
in the movies, can reassure themselves that they have isolated the contagion 
and need look no further&#151;and the more vitriolic their denunciations 
of the enemy, the more afraid everyone else is to admit what they have 
in common with him.</p>
<p> Once again&#151;we live in a violent world. It&#146;s as sensible to 
blame any one of us for being colonized by this violence as it is to blame 
the oceans for being polluted. The question should not be whether an individual 
is guilty&#151;we all are, at least of complicity&#151;but rather how 
to enable all individuals to confront and transform the violence and ignorance 
within themselves. Often nothing can help an person to do this more than 
to offer him forgiveness, to trust that he is interested in communicating 
with you; this makes it easier for him to drop his defenses and acknowledge 
what you have to say. This is not to say that we shouldn&#146;t defend 
ourselves whenever we have to, and by any means necessary&#151;but let&#146;s 
do this for practical reasons, not out of a thirst for revenge and superiority.</p>
<h5> <i>&#147;Righteousness is a premium currency in this post-Christian 
society, though it refers to a mythical world.&#148;</i></h5>
<h3> Objectivity vs. Subjectivity</h3>
<p> Objectivity thinking, on which our scarcity-oriented, authoritarian 
civilization is based, posits that there is only one truth. According 
to this school of reasoning, those who want to explain human behavior 
or overthrow capitalism should make different propositions regarding the 
best way to do this, and debate them until the &#147;correct&#148; one 
is selected. And so, in the ivory towers, intellectuals and armchair revolutionaries 
debate incessantly, coming no closer to consensus, developing more and 
more exclusive jargon, while the rest of us labor to make something actually 
happen. Subjectivity thinking accepts that there is no &#147;the&#148; 
reality, and infers that any &#147;objective&#148; reality must simply 
be one subjective reality institutionalized as Truth by those in power. 
Subjectivity thinking recognizes that people have arrived at their particular 
beliefs and behaviors as a result of their individual life experiences. 
This has an important bearing on how we interact with each other, especially 
in our efforts to change the world. Different people are going to have 
different beliefs, tactics, goals. Accept this. They don&#146;t necessarily 
think differently than you do because they are not as smart or experienced 
or perceptive as you&#151;they may be your equals in all these regards, 
but come to different conclusions based on different evidence from their 
own lives. Respect this, while offering whatever perspectives you can 
yourself&#151;keeping in mind that the less you have in common, the more 
you would do well to listen rather than speak. When hearing a person&#146;s 
position on an issue, you don&#146;t have to immediately begin debating 
which of you is right. Instead, try to think of projects you could undertake 
together that would further the interests you have in common. Whatever 
ideological issues need to be worked out can be worked out in practice, 
if they can be worked out at all&#151;they certainly will not be resolved 
by another contest of egos disguised as a debate about theory<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('Also in taking sides against others, you can forget that everyones positions are fluid; forcing someone to act as a partisan of one side can trap them into identifying themselves with that side exclusively.', CAPTION, '[3]');" onmouseout="nd();">[3]</a>.</p>
<p> Obviously, it&#146;s impossible for anyone to legislate for everyone 
else, since every life experience is unique&#151;nevertheless, you can 
offer your own experiences and conclusions, for others to do with what 
they will (in the words of the divine Marquis: &#147;if you can speak 
honestly for yourself, you will find you have spoken for others as well&#148;). 
This may be seen as legislating, by those who believe that there is only 
one right way; but those who attack you for offering your own perspective 
or analysis, on the grounds that it doesn&#146;t apply to them (or isn&#146;t 
relevant to all people, starving mothers in Somalia, the transgendered 
community, etc.) are still working within the scarcity model.</p>
<p> Remember&#151;every value you hold, every decision you make, you make 
for yourself alone. The scarcity-thinkers will attack you as if you are 
deciding for everyone&#151;don&#146;t fall into the trap of their thinking 
by arguing for your own methods and ideas as universals. Simply point 
out that you act according to your own conscience, and hope to integrate 
your approach into those of others&#151;just as it is up to others to 
do with you.</p>
<h3>The Capitalism of Ideas</h3>
<p> Those who still hold that there is such a thing as &#147;objective&#148; 
truth generally feel a compulsion to persuade others of their truths. 
This is the self-perpetuating consequence of the power struggles that 
go on in the market of ideas; as in any economy based on scarcity, this 
market is characterized by competition between capitalists who strive 
to preserve and increase their power over others.</p>
<p> In our society, ideas function as capital in much the same way money 
does<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('Ideas, like other forms of capital, are considered private property, and protected by law in the cases of plagiarism and copyright infringement, for example.', CAPTION, '[4]');" onmouseout="nd();">[4]</a>. Individuals 
who can get others to &#147;buy in&#148; to their ideas obtain a disproportionate 
amount of control over their surroundings; large conglomerates (the Catholic 
Church, the Communist Party) can come to rule large parts of the world 
this way, just as corporations do&#151;indeed, there can be no entrenched 
political or financial power without ideological capital to back it up. 
Little &#147;start-up companies&#148; of competing ideas can enter the 
market to contest such monopolies, and sometimes one unseats the reigning 
creed to become the new dominant paradigm; but as in any capitalist system, 
power tends to flow upward to the top of a hierarchy, from which the masters, 
the ones qualified to employ it, decide matters for everyone else . . 
. and, just as in financial capitalism, ultimately it is not even the 
ruling class but competition itself that is in control. In this environment, 
anyone with a value or viewpoint has to rush to sell it to others before 
being run out of business.</p>
<p> It&#146;s hard to imagine from here what a world free from this war 
of ideologies would be like. Obviously, it would have to be a world free 
from analogous wars (for money, power, selfhood), too, for it&#146;s foolish 
to insist that &#147;one can think however one wants&#148; when some ways 
of conceptualizing the cosmos are punished by exclusion or embargo. Those 
of us who fight for freedom from the power of gods and masters would do 
well to contest the dictatorships of ideology&#151;any ideology&#151;which 
always accompany and enable them<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('This statement, paradoxically, rests on ideological assumptions of its own but perhaps this kind of self-contradiction is the first, necessary step in the disarmament of ideology.', CAPTION, '[5]');" onmouseout="nd();">[5]</a>.</p>
<h3> Why People Don&#146;t Want to &#147;Join the Movement&#148;</h3>
<p> Considering the numbers of public relations agents, televangelists, 
self-help gurus, and other assorted fanatics and salesmen competing to 
convert them, the hesitance &#147;the masses&#148; show to get involved 
in any kind of social movement is actually a healthy self-defense mechanism. 
Thus the biggest challenge for those who would find common cause with 
others to make revolutionary change is how to avoid making them defensive 
in the process.</p>
<p> Radical politics does make people feel defensive in the West today&#151;this 
is a greater obstacle to social transformation than any corporate control 
or government repression. And this is due in large part to the attitudes 
of the activists themselves: many activists have invested in their activist 
identities as an act of compensation at least as much as out of a genuine 
desire to make things happen&#151;for them, activism serves the same function 
that machismo, fashion, popularity serve for others. Activists who are 
still serving the imperatives of insecurity tend to alienate others&#151;they 
may even unconsciously want to alienate others, so they can stand alone 
as the virtuous vanguard. Seeing such activists in action, people who 
don&#146;t have the same insecurities to placate assume that activism 
has nothing to do with their own lives and needs. Whenever we have an 
idea for a &#147;revolutionary&#148; project&#151;we must ask ourselves: 
Are we certain of our motivations? Will our words and deeds mobilize and 
enable, or immobilize and discourage? Are we trying to create a spectacle 
of our freedom/compassion/erudition, to establish our status as revolutionaries/leaders/intellectual 
theorists, to claim the moral high ground, to win at the childish competition 
of who is most oppressed (as if suffering was quantifiable!), still seeking 
power and revenge in the guise of liberation? People can tell when you 
are lording yourself over them or playing a role, just as they can sense 
when you are acting out of honesty and joy. They&#146;re much more likely 
to respond to that, since their lives are already filled with enough role-playing 
and rivalry.</p>
<p> We would do better to abandon the crusade to &#147;convert the masses,&#148; 
with all its patronizing implications that others are lazy, blind, weak, 
victimized, in need of guidance. Instead&#151;first, we ought to reach 
out to those who are in situations similar to ours, or ones we have been 
in; these people, with whom we have the most in common, are the ones to 
whom our perspectives can be most useful<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('I grew up as a middle class rebel, a punk rocker. When I gave up trying to push reforms through the established channels and began organizing with others from my background, I realized what a vast, untapped force this demographic has to offer.', CAPTION, '[6]');" onmouseout="nd();">[6]</a>. 
Second, we can find people already active in communities other than ours 
with whom we share values and goals, and work with them&#151;this is vastly 
preferable to entering others&#146; communities and attempting to &#147;organize&#148; 
them according to the doctrines of outsiders<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('We were thrilled to discover that just one neighborhood over there was a group organizing in the Hispanic community according to the same anarchist principles we were, just using different words for the same things. When we sat in on one of their meetings, it became clear to us how much more we could be doing.', CAPTION, '[7]');" onmouseout="nd();">[7]</a>. 
Third, we can endeavor to defend others from the encroachments of power 
and ideology&#151;and extend to them whatever tools we have developed 
in our own struggles, to apply as they see fit outside our agendas<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('When the locals began joining in the streetfighting, we showed them how to make their shirts into masks so the police couldnt identify them, and how to use lime juice to protect themselves from the tear gas—thats anarchist leadership in action, or what we have in place of it: sharing our skills with others, spreading power, instead of concentrating it.', CAPTION, '[8]');" onmouseout="nd();">[8]</a>. 
Finally, we can find common cause with people on the grounds of the &#147;antisocial&#148; 
things they are already doing and feeling: theft, vandalism and graffiti, 
&#147;laziness,&#148; rebelliousness, general nihilism, compassion.</p>
<p> This is the real significance of the &#147;glorification&#148; of shoplifting, 
adultery, etc. that some radical propaganda indulges in: not to argue 
that shoplifting itself is revolution in action (or for that matter that 
one must shoplift to be radical&#151;as if revolution was a commodity 
in a scarcity economy, only available through certain channels!), but 
to establish connections to the daily lives and resistances of individuals 
who are not yet acting out of an articulated desire for revolution. The 
radical significance of a statement is in the effects of making it, not 
in whether or not it is &#147;objectively&#148; true. On the grounds of 
the private longings and frustrations people feel&#151;their hatred for 
busywork, the joy in transgression they find they share with teenagers 
and anarchists, the instinctive suspicion with which they approach all 
totalitarian systems&#151;a resistance can be established that proceeds 
from the individual motivations and standpoints of all those who comprise 
it, rather than the demands of political parties and dogmas. This is the 
only kind of resistance that can rescue us from both authoritarian power 
and authoritarian ideology.</p>
<p> When it comes to &#147;under-represented&#148; perspectives, remember&#151;it&#146;s 
not your role to &#147;represent&#148; them, as the politicians &#147;represent&#148; 
us. Better to do your best to represent yourself, and encourage others 
to do the same . . . for example, by listening to those who already are. 
Some people may dismiss your perspective (as &#147;middle class,&#148; 
&#147;reformist,&#148; &#147;extremist,&#148; etc.), but there is no such 
thing as an illegitimate perspective&#151;it is only illegitimate to act 
as if any perspective is not legitimate. A lot of this goes on, often 
perpetrated in the name of the under-represented (an easy trick!) by those 
who aren&#146;t necessarily under-represented themselves. Don&#146;t be 
intimidated&#151;you can be sure that if you are feeling something, someone 
else is feeling it, too, and needs to know she is not alone.</p>
<h3>Not Unity, But Harmony</h3>
<p> Any kind of &#147;resistance movement&#148; is going to develop conflicts 
over strategy (&#147;violent&#148; vs. &#147;non-violent,&#148; etc.), 
as different individuals construct their own analyses and test them out 
in practice. To contest this diversity rather than seeking to benefit 
from it&#151;to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by turning opportunities 
to address important issues into squabbles&#151;is to wish everyone had 
the same life history and perspective. Teenage hoodlums are not going 
to find the same things liberating as middle-aged librarians do&#151;but 
both have a stake in liberation, and must be a part of any struggle for 
it. Those who would set rules for the unruly and regulations for the irregular 
would deny the complexity not only of human beings but also of the revolution 
we hope to make.</p>
<p> Others are always going to have different approaches and goals than 
you do; the challenge is not to convert them to your own strategy (for 
who knows&#151;could it be they actually know better than you what is 
good for them?), but rather to find ways to integrate divergent methods 
into a mutually beneficial whole. Like it or not, if you feel that another&#146;s 
tactics are ineffective or counterproductive, it is up to you to find 
and add the missing ingredient that can make them effective&#151;otherwise, 
all the energy they put into their efforts is not only wasted, but turned 
against them and everyone else. Under such circumstances it will be much 
easier to point fingers and lay blame&#151;but this accomplishes nothing.</p>
<p> Approaches that speak clearly to some people may alienate others&#151;even 
and especially proclaimed activists (though, really, the last people any 
given approach needs to reach or please are people who are already radicalized). 
In these cases, it&#146;s important not to feel too threatened, since 
you may not actually be&#151;and to keep in mind that with the vast diversity 
of lives on this planet, we&#146;ll need an equally diverse arsenal of 
outreaches. In other cases, approaches that seem to contradict each other 
may actually form a perfect symbiosis: as in the relationship between 
masked rioters and well-behaved, well-spoken proponents of social change. 
No one in power would take heed of the latter without the former behind 
them (imagine Martin Luther King&#146;s nonviolence without the implicit 
threat of Malcolm X&#146;s confrontational stance), and without &#147;respectable&#148; 
support, insurgents can easily be marginalized and destroyed. In these 
situations, all parties should remember that others may even have to publicly 
disavow their tactics in order to continue doing their part effectively<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('As the black-masked corporate window-smasher yelled at the law-abiding liberal protester who tried to restrain her: It&rsquo;s not your job to stop me from making your cause look bad, but to distance yourself from my actions as much as you have to to keep the respect of the demographic youre trying to reach! It&rsquo;s my job to make something happen here so they&rsquo;ll have to listen to you in the fucking first place!', CAPTION, '[9]');" onmouseout="nd();">[9]</a>; 
when this happens, there should be no hard feelings.</p>
<p> Certainly it can be difficult to work alongside people who profess beliefs 
entirely different from yours&#151;and you should never work with others 
you fear will betray you or hijack your efforts to serve their own ends. 
But, again, ask yourself: are your positions significant to you as positions&#151;possessions, 
status symbols, badges of identity&#151;or as generalizations that exist 
to help you create more fulfilling moments of life? It&#146;s common sense 
to integrate the differing tactics of those who share a common goal; it&#146;s 
more challenging, but equally important, to put aside your compulsion 
to persuade everyone else of your opinions when you must, and work to 
create harmony between individuals who live in totally different worlds. 
That harmony might never be complete&#151;but it&#146;s a nobler objective 
than any kind of unity enforced by standardization.</p>
<h3>Working in Collectives</h3>
<p> Just as a band needs musicians who play different instruments, healthy 
associations don&#146;t restrict the participants with &#147;compromises&#148; 
that force them to limit themselves to the things they have in common, 
but instead integrate their dissimilarities into a whole greater than 
the sum of its parts. Working and living in such arrangements, in which 
every person is conscious that she is responsible for making the projects 
and relationships work, helps one learn to see oneself as a part of the 
web of human relations, rather than as an automaton against the world. 
Under these circumstances, others&#146; desires must be taken as seriously 
as one&#146;s own&#151;and this can actually allow an individual to be 
a more complete person, as her companions can represent parts of herself 
for her that she would not otherwise express. This makes sense, for everyone 
is ultimately a product of the same world&#151;we are all interconnected, 
each manifesting different aspects of the same interplay of forces. Without 
this insight, cooperation and community can only be incidental and haphazard.</p>
<p> Eventually, for the individual experienced in living communally, it 
becomes possible to regard the entire cosmos as one vast, albeit dysfunctional, 
collective; the problem is simply how to make its workings more to one&#146;s 
liking. This is not to say the fascists, sexists, etc. can go about their 
merry business and be &#147;part of our collective&#148;&#151;they&#146;d 
be the first ones to deny that, and follow it up with proof! But remember, 
the chief argument of fascism and reactionary thinking has always been 
that cooperation and autonomy are mutually exclusive, that people have 
to be ordered and controlled or else they will be lazy and kill each other. 
The more we can demonstrate this to be untrue, the less appeal their claims 
will have. &#147;Anyone who isn&#146;t on both sides of the issue is obviously 
against me from some direction.&#148;</p>
<p> Perhaps the most important thing you can do in this struggle is be there 
for others, help them believe in themselves, offer real compassion&#151;not 
the condescension of charity&#151;when it is needed. But there is no formula 
for this; mercy comes in the least predictable forms and from the most 
unexpected sources. Often it takes a person who has suffered something 
similar to be able to offer real succor to one who is suffering or struggling. 
That&#146;s another reason why it is good that we have all chosen different 
paths and suffered different things, even things that seemed to isolate 
us&#151;why there is a place even for spoiled rich kids and homeless drug 
addicts and lovers who have lied and betrayed in this struggle: for who 
else could relate to others in those difficult situations, offer them 
guidance and hope? When you recognize how your own tribulations have prepared 
you to help others, it can make sense of experiences that seemed unjustifiable; 
at the same time, this may help you to see the importance of others who 
previously appeared without worth.</p>
<p> Often we have our hands full dealing with our own pain, filled with 
too much bitterness and confusion to be able to offer others anything, 
least of all mercy. This means it is all the more critical that we not 
miss the opportunities we do get to be good to others&#151;whether or 
not they have &#147;earned&#148; it, whether or not we understand them, 
whether or not we think it will make a difference.</p>
<h3> War, or Revolution?</h3>
<p> We would-be revolutionaries so frequently frame our project in martial 
terms: we set out to Fight Racism, Smash Fascism, Destroy Capitalism, 
Eat the Rich. This enables us to see ourselves as noble crusaders&#151;and 
more importantly, to have adversaries, which reassures us of our own righteousness. 
This reassurance is apparently more precious than the success in our efforts 
it replaces and prevents&#151;at least, it is so long as one hasn&#146;t 
yet tasted that success. We have to remember in every instant that our 
enemies are not human beings: our enemies are the conditions that make 
us enemies.</p>
<p> A world entirely without enemies is not possible&#151;it&#146;s not 
even desirable, for most&#151;but understand, war is business as usual 
for capitalist society: Exxon vs. Shell, U.S.A. vs. Iraq, Communists vs. 
Anarchists, lover against lover and parent against child. Even if we could 
kill every last rapist, C.E.O., head of state, police officer, and housemate 
who won&#146;t do the dishes, that violence would remain in the world 
as the venom and fury of those who survived them (not to mention the ways 
those murders would leave their mark on us)&#151;that&#146;s karma for 
you. Revolution is what happens when you create situations that make the 
old conflicts&#151;all that inertia of resentment and insecurity and antagonism&#151;irrelevant.</p>
<p> Of course warfare is necessary sometimes&#151;we have to fight all efforts 
to keep us at war with each other, and for some of us this will mean violence. 
But, as the venerable sage once pointed out, &#147;if it&#146;s you against 
the world, bet on the world.&#148; So many of us alienate ourselves so 
needlessly from others, eventually relying on some abstraction (&#147;the 
working class,&#148; &#147;the imminent insurrection&#148;) for camaraderie 
once every companion of flesh and blood is gone, or, worse, concluding 
that cooperation is simply impossible&#151;when history shows that it 
is possible, just not for you, until you&#146;re ready to be more patient, 
considerate, humble, forgiving.</p>
<p> When you can be generous enough not to blame another for her incoherence, 
selfishness, mistakes, bad ideas, even acts of violence, you can discern 
what she has to offer you. When you can put into practice a form of justice 
that takes responsibility for setting things aright, you can heal, rather 
than impotently dispensing guilt and glory. When you can be patient with 
impatience, when you can resist contemptation, when you can refrain from 
being self-righteous even and especially with the self-righteous, you 
can do your part to liberate all of us prisoners of war.</p>
<p> Doing things you enjoy will help you not to take your frustrations out 
on others&#151;as will working with people you like, whenever it&#146;s

There&#146;s nothing noble or revolutionary about &#147;sacrificing yourself 
for the cause,&#148; especially when it makes you impossible to be around. 
At the same time, it won&#146;t&#151;and shouldn&#146;t&#151;always be 
possible to surround yourself with people who see things the way you do: 
be ready to leave your comfort zone, and bring a generous heart when you 
do.</p>
<p> This is dedicated to all those who have done this over the years, who 
have taken it for granted that for all their clumsiness, people from other 
backgrounds and advocates of other tactics really did desire to coexist 
and cooperate with them: to the men and women of the working class who 
took the time to explain to bourgeois activists how they were alienating 
them, even when the latter did not at first know how to listen; to the 
women who not only demanded that men recognize the existence and effects 
of their sexism, but also acknowledged the fears and anxieties they felt; 
to the survivors of abuse who went on to give counseling to both abused 
and abusers. Without them, we would assuredly have torn each other to 
pieces already. It&#146;s frightening to let your guard down, it&#146;s 
hard to swallow your pride (even when clinging to it would mean betraying 
yourself)&#151;but this is the only way to help others do the same. Until 
they can, we will live in this barren world of shields and swords, each 
of us a city-state unto herself. Some anarchy.</p>
<p> Don&#146;t be intimidated by the colossal challenge of &#147;saving 
the world&#148;; there are as many worlds as there are people&#151;save 
yours, the one made up of the life you share with the ones around you. 
Where one flower blooms, a million more will follow.</p>
<p> I would like to be someone with whom no one would feel she had to be 
ashamed of any part of herself. I would like to be able to regard the 
actions of others without feeling threatened by them or becoming defensive, 
even when they are defensive with me&#151;to see others in the context 
of their lives, not my own. I would like to know how to set limits on 
how far I rely upon people, so as not to risk losing my ability to respect 
them. I would like to be able to look those adversaries who should be 
allies in the eyes and say <i>Like it or not, this is who I am. This is 
what the world has made of me, and we must all live with the consequences. 
I can&#146;t feel or believe or act differently than I do, let alone change 
the decades of life behind me that have wrought this. I don&#146;t want 
to compete with you for moral high ground or anything else. Unless you&#146;re 
prepared to kill everyone who doesn&#146;t line up with your standards, 
or to endure this impasse of animosity indefinitely, you&#146;re going 
to have to accept me on my own terms, as I hope to do with you. You are 
as responsible as I am for making what goes on between us positive for 
us both&#151;or for the world of strife we will live in otherwise. </i></p>

<p>[1] The other expression 
of this same affliction is hero worship, in which one projects all the 
qualities one finds admirable onto others. This is similarly crippling, 
of course, and inevitably leads back to the same hostility and scornfor 
the only thing you can do with individuals or groups you have put on a 
pedestal is knock them off.</p>
<p>[2] The self-righteous activists 
sense of justice is derived from the same origins as the justice system 
which feeds todays prison-industrial complex: a Christianity that emphasized 
individual responsibility over the cause and effect of social conditions, 
in order to invent, advertise, and sell the ultimate scarce commoditysalvation. 
In a state of truly mutually-beneficial social relations, such threats 
as incarceration and hellfire would be unnecessarythe threat of expulsion 
from the community would be dismaying enough.</p>
<p>[3] Also in taking sides 
against others, you can forget that everyones positions are fluid; forcing 
someone to act as a partisan of one side can trap them into identifying 
themselves with that side exclusively.</p>
<p>[4] Ideas, like other forms 
of capital, are considered private property, and protected by lawin the 
cases of plagiarism and copyright infringement, for example.</p>
<p>[5] This statement, paradoxically, 
rests on ideological assumptions of its ownbut perhaps this kind of self-contradiction 
is the first, necessary step in the disarmament of ideology.</p>
<p>[6] I grew up as a middle 
class rebel, a punk rocker. When I gave up trying to push reforms through 
the established channels and began organizing with others from my background, 
I realized what a vast, untapped force this demographic has to offer. 
</p>
<p>[7] e were thrilled to discover 
that just one neighborhood over there was a group organizing in the Hispanic 
community according to the same anarchist principles we were, just using 
different words for the same things. When we sat in on one of their meetings, 
it became clear to us how much more we could be doing.</p>
<p>[8] When the locals began 
joining in the streetfighting, we showed them how to make their shirts 
into masks so the police couldnt identify them, and how to use lime juice 
to protect themselves from the tear gas&#151;thats anarchist leadership 
in action, or what we have in place of it: sharing our skills with others, 
spreading power, instead of concentrating it.</p>
<p>[9] As the black-masked corporate 
window-smasher yelled at the law-abiding liberal protester who tried to 
restrain her: It's not your job to stop me from making your cause look 
bad, but to distance yourself from my actions as much as you have to to 
keep the respect of the demographic youre trying to reach! Its my job 
to make something happen here so they'll have to listen to you in the 
fucking first place!</p>
<p>[10] Consensus-based organizing 
can sometimes create unnecessary conflict and interference. Organizing 
autonomously&#151;and trying another free association whenever one isn't 
working&#151;can give you the freedom you need not to resent others, so 
you can work well with the ones around you. Revolution may involve learning 
to live and act cooperatively, but that doesnt mean everyone has to be 
friends.</p></div>
