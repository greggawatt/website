<h1>Seduced by the Image of Reality</h1>
<p> When I would look through magazines as a small child, I used to think 
that there must be a magical world somewhere where everything looked&#151;and 
was&#151;perfect. I could see pictures from it in those pages, the smoky air 
of dimly-lit rooms heavy with drama as the young models lounged in designer 
fashions. That is where excitement and adventure is to be found, I thought, 
in the world where every room is flawlessly decorated and every woman's 
wardrobe is picked and matched with daring and finesse. I resolved to 
have an adventurous life of my own, and began looking for those rooms 
and women right away. And though I've discovered since then that romance 
and excitement rarely come hand in hand with the images of them that are 
presented to us&#151;usually the opposite is true, that adventure is to be 
found precisely where there is no time or energy for keeping up appearances&#151;I 
still catch myself sometimes thinking that everything would be perfect 
if only I lived in that picturesque log cabin with matching rugs. </p>
<p> Whatever each us may be looking for, we all tend to pursue our desires 
by pursuing images: symbols of the things we desire. We buy leather jackets 
when we want rebellion and danger. We purchase fast cars not for the sake 
of driving fast, but to recapture our lost youth. When we want world revolution, 
we buy political pamphlets and bumper stickers. Somehow we assume that 
having all the right accessories will get us the perfect lives. And when 
we construct our lives, we often do it according to an image, a pattern 
that has been laid out for us: hippie, businessman, housewife, punk. </p>
<p> Why do we think so much about images today, rather than concentrating 
on reality, on our lives and emotions themselves? One of the reasons images 
have attained so much significance in this society is that, unlike activities, 
images are easy to sell. Advertising and marketing, which are designed 
to invest products with a symbolic value that will attract consumers, 
have transformed our culture. Corporations have been spreading propaganda 
designed to make us believe in the magic powers of their commodities for 
generations now: deodorant offers popularity, soda offers youth and energy, 
jeans offer sex appeal. At our jobs, we exchange our time, energy, and 
creativity for the ability to buy these symbols&#151;and we keep buying them, 
for of course no quantity of cigarettes can really give anyone sophistication. 
Rather than satisfying our needs, these products multiply them: for in 
order to get them, we end up selling parts of our lives away. We keep 
going back, not knowing any other way, hoping that the new product (self-help 
books, punk rock records, that vacation cabin with matching rugs) will 
be the one that will fix everything. </p>
<p>We are easily persuaded to chase these images because it is simply easier 
to change the scenery around you than it is to change your own life. How 
much less trouble, how much less risky it would be if you could make your 
life perfect just by collecting all the right accessories! No participation 
necessary. The image comes to embody all the things you desire, and you 
spend all your time and energy trying to get the details right (the bohemian 
tries to find the perfect black beret and the right poetry readings to 
attend&#151;the frat boy has to be seen with the right friends, at the right 
parties, drinking the right beers and wearing the right informal dress 
shirts) rather than pursuing the desires themselves&#151;for of course it's 
easier to identify yourself with a prefabricated image than to identify 
exactly what you want in life. But if you really want adventure, an Australian 
hunting jacket won't suffice, and if you want real romance, dinner and 
a movie with the most popular girl at your school might not be enough. 
</p>
<p> Fascinated as we are by images, our values have come to revolve around 
a world we can never actually experience. There's no way into the pages 
of the magazine, there's no way to be the archetypal punk or the perfect 
executive. We're "trapped" out here in the real world, forever. And yet 
we keep looking for life in pictures, in fashions, in spectacles of all 
kinds, anything that we can collect or watch&#151;instead of doing. </p>
<h3>WE LOOK FOR LIFE IN THE IMAGE OF LIFE.</h3>
<h4> Watching from the Sidelines</h4>
<p> The curious thing about a spectacle is how it immobilizes the spectators: 
just like the image, it centers their attention, their values, and ultimately 
their lives around something outside of themselves. It keeps them occupied 
without making them active, it keeps them feeling involved without giving 
them control. You can probably think of a thousand different examples 
of this: television programs, action movies, magazines that give updates 
on the lives of celebrities and superstars, spectator sports, representative 
"democracy," the Catholic church. </p>
<p> A spectacle also isolates the people whose attention it commands. Many 
of us know more about the fictitious characters of popular sitcoms than 
we know about the lives and loves of our neighbors&#151;for even when we talk 
to them, it is about television shows, the news, and the weather; thus 
the very experiences and information that we share in common as spectators 
of the mass-media serve to separate us from one another. It is the same 
at a big football game: everybody watching from the bleachers is a nobody, 
regardless of who they are. They may be sitting next to each other, but 
all eyes are focused on the field. If they speak to each other, it is 
almost never about each other, but about the game that is being played 
before them. And although football fans cannot participate in the events 
of the game they are watching, or exert any real influence over them, 
they attach the utmost importance to these events and associate their 
own needs and desires with their outcome in a most unusual way. Rather 
than concentrating their attention on things that have a real bearing 
on their desires, they reconstruct their desires to revolve around the 
things they pay attention to. Their language even conflates the achievements 
of the team they identify themselves with with their own actions: "we 
scored a goal!" "we won!" shout the fans from their seats and sofas. </p>
<p> This stands in stark contrast to the way people speak about the things 
that go on in our own cities and communities. "They're building a new 
highway," we say about the new changes in our neighborhood. "What will 
they think of next?" we say about the latest advances in scientific technology. 
Our language reveals that we think of ourselves as spectators in our own 
societies. But it's not "They," the mysterious Other People, who have 
made the world the way it is&#151;it is we, humanity ourselves. No small team 
of scientists, city planners, and rich bureaucrats could have done all 
the working and inventing and organizing that it has taken for us to transform 
this planet; it has taken and still takes all of us, working together, 
to do this. We are the ones doing it, every day. And yet most of us seem 
to feel that we can have more control over football games than we can 
over our cities, our jobs, even our own lives. </p>
<p>We might have more success in our pursuit of happiness if we start trying 
to really participate. Rather than trying to fit images, we can seek exciting 
and rewarding experiences; for happiness does not come from what you have 
or how your appear, but from what you do and how you feel. And instead 
of accepting the role of passive spectator to sports, society, and life, 
it is up to each of us to figure out how to play an active and significant 
part in creating the worlds around us and within us. Perhaps one day we 
can build a new society in which we can all be involved together in the 
decisions that affect the lives we lead; then we will be able to truly 
choose our own destinies, instead of feeling helpless and left out. </p>
<h5> What's the point of doing anything <br />
if nobody's watching?</h5>
<p> We all want to be famous, to be seen, frozen, preserved in the media, 
because we've come to trust what is seen more than what is actually lived. 
Somehow we've gotten everything backwards and images seem more real to 
us than experiences. To know that we really exist, that we really matter, 
we have to see ghosts of ourselves preserved in photographs, on television 
shows and videotapes, in the public eye. </p>
<p> And when you go on vacation, what do you see? Scores of tourists with 
video cameras screwed to their faces, as if they're trying to suck all 
of the real world into the two-dimensional world of images, spending their 
"time off" seeing the world through a tiny glass lens. Sure, turning everything 
that you could experience with all five senses into recorded information 
that you can only observe from a distance, detached, offers us the illusion 
of having control over our lives: we can rewind and replay them, over 
and over, until everything looks ridiculous. But what kind of life is 
that? </p>
