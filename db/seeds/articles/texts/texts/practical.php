<h1>Practical Tips for  CrimethInc. Agents</h1>
<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0px">LIE and CHEAT.</h2>
<h3 style="padding-top: 5px">Hypocrisy</h3>
<h5>The will to a system is the will to a lie.</h5> 
<p> <i>Today it is impossible to avoid hypocrisy in any struggle against 
the status quo.</i> 
<p> The political and economic structures are constructed so that it is 
practically impossible to avoid being implicated in their workings. Today, 
whatever a man thinks of the employment opportunities available to him 
or of our economic system itself, he has almost no choice except to work 
if he does not want to starve to death or die of an illness for which 
he could not afford health care. If he does not believe in material property, 
he still has no choice but to buy all the food and clothing he needs and 
to buy or rent living space (that is, if he is not ready to live at odds 
with our very effective legal system)&#151;for there is no free land left 
that has not been claimed by someone, almost no food or other resources 
anywhere that are not someone's "property." If a woman wants to distribute 
material criticizing the capitalist system of production and consumption, 
she still has no way to produce and distribute this material without paying 
to produce it, and selling it to consumers&#151;or at least selling advertising, 
which encourages people to be consumers&#151;to finance production. If a woman 
does not want to finance the brutal torture and slaughter of animals in 
the name of capitalism, she can stop eating meat and dairy products, purchasing 
health products which are tested on animals, and wearing leather and fur; 
but there are still animal products in the films in her camera and the 
movies she watches, in the vinyl records she listens to, and in countless 
other products which she will be hard-pressed to do without in modern 
society. Besides, the companies she buys her vegetables from are most 
likely connected to the companies who make meat and dairy products, so 
her money goes to the same ends; and these vegetables themselves were 
probably picked by migrant workers or other oppressed labor. 
<p> And at the same time, modern Western culture is so deeply ingrained 
in our minds, indoctrinated with it as we are from an early age, that 
it is practically impossible to avoid being influenced in our actions 
by the very assumptions and values which we are struggling against. After 
a lifetime of being taught to place a financial value on the hours of 
our lives, it is hard to stop feeling like one must be rewarded materially 
for an activity for it to be worthwhile. After a lifetime of being taught 
to respect hierarchies of authority, it is very difficult to suddenly 
interact with all human beings as equals. After a lifetime of being taught 
to associate happiness with passive spectatorship, it is hard to enjoy 
building furniture more than watching television. And of course there 
are ten thousand more subtle ways in which these values and assumptions 
manifest themselves in our thoughts and our actions. 
<p> This does not mean that resistance is futile. Indeed, if our choices 
today are so limited that we cannot act without replicating the conditions 
from which we were trying to escape, resistance is all the more crucial. 
This does mean that "innocence" is a myth, a counter-revolutionary concept 
which we must leave behind us with the rest of post-Christian thinking. 
The traditional Christian demand upon human beings is that they be innocent, 
that they keep their hands clean of any "sin." At the same time, "sin" 
is so difficult for the Christian to avoid (as counter-revolutionary activity 
is today, for us) that this demand leads to feelings of guilt and failure 
in the believer, and ultimately to despair, when he realizes that it is 
impossible for him to be "innocent" and "pure." In fact, by forbidding 
"sin," Christian doctrine makes it all the more tempting and intriguing 
for the believer; for whether the mind does or not, the human heart recognizes 
no authority and will always seek out that which is not permitted to it. 
<p> We must not make the same mistakes as Christianity. The demand that 
people be free from hypocrisy, free from any implication in the system, 
will result in the same effects as the Christian demand that people be 
free from sin: it will create frustration and despair in those who would 
seek change, and at the same time it will make hypocrisy all the more 
tempting. Rather than seek to have hands that are clean of implication 
in the systems we struggle against, we should aim to make the inevitable 
negative effects of our lives worthwhile by offering enough positive activity 
to more than balance the scales. This approach to the problem will save 
us from being immobilized by fear of hypocrisy or shame about our "guilt." 
<p> Besides, demands that we avoid hypocrisy deny the complexity of the 
human soul. The human heart is not simple; every human being has a variety 
of desires which pull him or her in different directions. To ask that 
a human being only pursue some of those desires and always ignore others 
is to ask that he or she remain permanently unfulfilled. . . and curious. 
This is typical of the kind of dogmatic, ideological thinking which has 
afflicted us for centuries: it insists that the individual must be loyal 
to one set of rules and only one, rather than doing what is appropriate 
for his or her needs in a particular situation. 
<p> It might well be true that the whole self can only be expressed in hypocrisy. 
Certainly a person needs to formulate a general set of guidelines regarding 
the decisions he will make, but to break occasionally from these guidelines 
will prevent stagnation and offer an opportunity to consider whether any 
of the guidelines need reevaluation. A person who is not afraid to be 
hypocritical from time to time is in a great deal less danger of selling 
out permanently one day, because he or she is able to taste the "forbidden 
fruit" without feeling forced to make a permanent choice. This person 
will be immune to the shame and eventual despair that will afflict the 
person who strives for perfect "innocence." 
<p> So be proud of yourself as you are, don't try to get the inconsistencies 
in your soul to match up in a false and forced manner or it will only 
come back to haunt you. Rather than holding inflexibly to a set system, 
let us dare to reject the idea that we must be faithful to any particular 
doctrine in our efforts to create a better life for ourselves. Let us 
not claim to be innocent, let us not claim to be pure or right! But let 
us proclaim proudly that we are hypocrites, that we will stop at nothing, 
not even hypocrisy, in our struggle to take control of our lives. In this 
age when it is impossible to avoid being a part of the system we strive 
against, only blatant hypocrisy is truly subversive&#151;for it alone speaks 
the truth about our hearts, and it alone can show just how difficult it 
is to avoid living the modern life which has been prepared for us. And 
that alone is good reason to fight. 
<h4> Exhibit A: CrimethInc. Itself "insINC.ere"</h4>
<p> The CrimethInc. collective is a perfect example of the difficulties 
a subversive organization will encounter in seeking to avoid hypocrisy, 
and of the liberating possibilities that embracing hypocrisy can create. 
<p> Harbinger exists to criticize such modern phenomena as advertising, 
which is fundamentally an effort on the part of modern businesses to influence 
people to purchase their products whether or not this is in their best 
interest. And yet CrimethInc. must sell advertising in the pages of Harbinger 
in order to finance its publication. Harbinger exists to warn against 
those who would sell ideologies that prescribe certain kinds of thinking 
and acting, whether or not these manners of thinking and acting are in 
the best interest of human beings. And yet, in order to compete with these 
forces, CrimethInc. too must sell an ideology of sorts: an ideology of 
"thinking for yourself," but an ideology all the same. Certainly we may 
claim that our products, our ideologies, really are in the best interest 
of human beings, but isn't that what every corporation and political party 
claims? 
<p> Thus it is impossible for us in CrimethInc. to pursue the goals we seek 
without simultaneously betraying those goals. Just as we strive to fight 
against the system, we replicate it. Selling "revolutionary" ideas is 
still selling ideas, and as long as buying and selling are taking place, 
nothing truly revolutionary is happening. Indeed the fact that "revolutionary" 
ideas are being used to perpetuate the status quo means that whatever 
resistance there might be is neutralized and assimilated from the start. 
<p> On the other hand, activity is better than inactivity, and perhaps the 
efforts that we make here will still be able to have positive effects 
despite being necessarily compromised. And perhaps our willingness to 
point out where we are compromised will prevent those compromises from 
rendering our efforts useless. It might be possible to incite genuine 
to change in the lives of human beings, despite the implication inherent 
in any kind of activity today; and even if it is not, it must still be 
worth a try. 
<p> Of course, perhaps this sort of idealism will only serve to trick us, 
with the best of all possible intentions, into betraying the very ideals 
which we seek to promote. Perhaps we are sealing our own fate by transforming 
whatever genuine desires for change people may have into ultimately ineffectual 
activities such as purchasing "revolutionary products" and discussing 
the ideas of others rather than creating their own. Perhaps the advertising 
we sell in Harbinger will only lead people to purchase the products advertised 
(and thus be forced to remain trapped in the wage slavery system), rather 
than just harmlessly raising the funds necessary to publish our demand 
for the end of this system. Or maybe this hypocrisy is merely a cover 
that allows us to go about our business of revolution without appearing 
to be much of a threat, by making us appear to be another innocuous, pseudo-revolutionary 
group; perhaps we only appear to be hopelessly compromised so that the 
forces that have a stake in the status quo will not recognize the threat 
that we do pose until it is too late. And it might even be that CrimethInc. 
is actually orchestrated by those very forces, to lead those who do desire 
change astray into expending their efforts uselessly! Even then, it might 
have unforeseen effects. . . Who can tell for sure? 
<p> The thing is to act, to act joyously, not to accept that we are helpless 
to effect change, even if we really are. For if we seek to resist the 
roles and lives set forward for us, if we fight a spirited fight against 
the forces that would keep us in despair, if we dare to act on our own 
and to act passionately and joyously, then that is in itself the revolution 
we seek.

<h5> <i>The marketplace of ideas, <br />
like any marketplace, is fit only for looting. 
</i> </h5>
<h4>I. "Intellectual Property"</h4> <p>We have all been taught from our youth that 
"there is nothing new under the sun." Whenever a child has an exciting 
idea, an older person is quick to point out either that this idea has 
been tried before and didn't work, or that someone else not only has already 
had the idea but also has developed and expounded upon it to greater lengths 
than the child ever could. "Learn and choose from the ideas and beliefs 
already in circulation, rather than seeking to develop and arrange your 
own," seems to be the message, and this message is sent clearly by the 
methods of "instruction" used in both public and private schools throughout 
the West. 
<p> Despite this common attitude, or perhaps because of it, we are very 
possessive of our ideas. The concept of "intellectual property" is ingrained 
in the collective psychosis much deeper than the concept of material property. 
Plenty of thinkers have appeared who have asserted that "property is theft" 
in regard to real estate and other physical capital, but few have dared 
to make similar statements about their own ideas. Even the most notoriously 
"radical" thinkers have still proudly claimed their ideas as, first and 
foremost, their ideas. 
<p> Consequently, little distinction is made between the thinkers and their 
thoughts. Students of philosophy will study the philosophy of Descartes, 
students of economics will study Marx-ism, students of art will study 
the paintings of Dali. At worst, the cult of personality that develops 
around famous thinkers prevents any useful consideration of their ideas 
or artwork; hero-worshipping partisans will swear allegiance to a thinker 
and all his thoughts, while others who have some justified or unjustified 
objection to the conceiver of the ideas will generally have a difficult 
time not being prejudiced against the ideas themselves. At best, this 
emphasis upon the "author-owner" in the consideration of propositions 
or artwork is merely irrelevant to the worth of the actual propositions 
or artwork, even if the stories about the individual in question are interesting 
and can encourage creative thinking by themselves. 
<p> The very assumptions behind the concept of "intellectual property" require 
more attention than we have given them. The factors that affect the words 
and deeds of an individual are many and varied, not the least of them 
being her social-cultural climate and the input of other individuals. 
To say that any idea has its sole origins in the being of one individual 
man or woman is to grossly oversimplify. But we are so accustomed to claiming 
items and objects for ourselves, and to being forced to accept similar 
claims from others, in the cutthroat competition to acquire and dominate 
(before we are acquired and dominated) that is life in a market economy, 
that it seems natural to do the same with ideas. Certainly there must 
be other ways of thinking about the origins and ownership of ideas that 
warrant consideration. . . for our present approach does more than merely 
distract from the ideas. 
<p> Our tradition of recognizing "intellectual property rights" is dangerous 
in that it results in the deification of the publicly recognized "thinker" 
and "artist" at the expense of everyone else. When ideas are always associated 
with proper names (and always the same proper names, in point of fact), 
this suggests that thinking and creating are special skills that belong 
to a select few individuals. For example, the glorification of the "artist" 
in our culture, which includes the stereotyping of artists as eccentric 
"visionaries" who exist at the edge (the "avant garde") of society, encourages 
people to believe that artists are significantly and fundamentally different 
from other human beings. Actually, anyone can be an artist, and everyone 
is, to some extent; being able to act creatively is a crucial element 
of human happiness. But when we are led to believe that being creative 
and thinking critically are talents which only a few individuals possess, 
those of us who are not fortunate enough to be christened "artists" or 
"philosophers" by our communities will not make much effort to develop 
these abilities. Consequently we will be dependent upon others for many 
of our ideas, and will have to be content as spectators of the creative 
work of others&#151;and we will feel alienated and unsatisfied. 
<p> Another incidental drawback of our association of ideas with specific 
individuals is that it promotes the acceptance of these ideas in their 
original form. The students who learn the philosophy of Descartes are 
encouraged to learn it in its orthodox form, rather than learning the 
parts which they find relevant to their own lives and interests and combining 
these parts with ideas from other sources. Out of deference to the original 
thinker, deified as he is in our tradition, his texts and theories are 
to be preserved as-is, without ever being put into new forms or contexts 
which might reveal new insights. Mummified as they are, many theories 
become completely irrelevant to modern existence, when they could have 
been given a new lease on life by being treated with a little less reverence. 
<p> So we can see that our acceptance of the tradition of "intellectual 
property" has negative effects upon our endeavors to think critically 
and learn from our artistic and philosophical heritage. What can we do 
to address this problem? One of the possible solutions is plagiarism. 
<h4>II. Plagiarism and the Modern Revolutionary</h4>
<p> Plagiarism is an especially effective method of appropriating and reorganizing 
ideas, and as such it can be a useful tool for a young man or woman looking 
to encourage new and exciting thinking in others. And it is a method that 
is revolutionary in that it does not recognize "intellectual property" 
rights but rather strikes out against them and all of the negative effects 
that recognizing them can have. 
<p> Plagiarism focuses attention on content and away from incidental issues, 
by making the genuine origins of the material impossible to ascertain. 
Besides, as suggested above, it could be argued that the genuine origins 
of the contents of most inspirations and propositions are impossible to 
determine anyway. By signing a new name, or no name at all, to a text, 
the plagiarizer puts the material in an entirely new context, and this 
may generate new perspectives and new thinking about the subject that 
have not appeared before. Plagiarism also makes it possible to combine 
the best or most relevant parts of a number of texts, thus creating a 
new text with many of the virtues of the older ones&#151;and some new virtues, 
as well, since the combination of material from different sources is bound 
to result in unforeseeable effects and might well result in the unlocking 
of hidden meanings or possibilities that have been dormant in the texts 
for years. Finally, above all, plagiarism is the reappropriation of ideas: 
when an individual plagiarizes a text which those who believe in intellectual 
property would have held "sacred," she denies that there is a difference 
in rank between herself and the thinker she takes from. She takes the 
thinker's ideas for herself, to express them as she sees fit, rather than 
treating the thinker as an authority whose work she is duty-bound to preserve 
as he intended. She denies, in fact, that there is a fundamental difference 
between the thinker and the rest of humanity, by appropriating the thinker's 
material as the property of humanity. 
<p> After all, a good idea should be available to everyone&#151;should belong 
to everyone&#151;if it really is a good idea. In a society organized with 
human happiness as the objective, copyright infringement laws and similar 
restrictions would not hinder the distribution and recombination of ideas. 
These impediments only make it more difficult for individuals who are 
looking for challenging and inspiring material to come upon it and share 
it with others. 
<p> So, if there truly is "nothing new under the sun," take them at their 
word, and act accordingly. Take what seems relevant to your life and your 
needs from the theories and doctrines prepared by those who came before 
you. Don't be afraid to reproduce word for word those texts which seem 
perfect to you, so you can share them with others who might also benefit 
from them. And at the same time, don't be afraid to plunder ideas from 
different sources and rearrange them in ways that you find more useful 
and exciting, more relevant to your own needs and experiences. Seek to 
create a personally constructed body of critical and creative thought, 
with elements gathered from as many sources as possible, rather than choosing 
from one of the prefabricated ideologies that are offered to you. After 
all, do we have ideas, or do they have us?</p>
