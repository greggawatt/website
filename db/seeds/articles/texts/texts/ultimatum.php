<p>
These travesties will continue without mercy or quarter until all our demands 
are met. This is not negotiable. These are no idle threats. Hell, all these 
things are happening right now, and have been for decades.</p>
<h3> We have demands, which we make upon every man, <br />
woman, 
girl, and boy:</h3>
<p>
-Each individual should seek a life that will constantly broaden her horizons, 
that will give her the experiences she needs to discern exactly what her 
greatest desires are. The important things cannot be taught or explained. 
Go search.</p><p>
-We need to create ways of satisfying our individual needs that simultaneously 
provide for the needs of others. Otherwise, every time we take care of our 
own needs, we simply reinforce the system of scarcity that makes others 
suffer&#151;and it is in no one&#146;s best interest that we live in a world 
of mutual distrust and misery.</p><p>
-Gift giving must replace exchange as the standard economic, social, and 
emotional transaction. And while everything still belongs to the hoarding 
exchangers (the &#147;possessed,&#148; we call them, those would-be possessors), 
let theft, squatting, trash scavenging, etc. enable us to begin this gift 
economy immediately.</p><p>
-We need control over all the resources of this society, not just the fragments 
we receive as individual consolation prizes, and we need social arrangements 
in which this control can be shared to everyone&#146;s advantage. It&#146;s 
not just a question of being free to pursue our desires, but even more so 
of being able to participate in the shaping of them&#151;and for that, we 
must share power over the world that does the shaping.</p><p>
We have the guns for war. They are the simple, infectious pleasure of breaking 
rules&#151;the loneliness shared by prom queens and executives on long business 
trips alike, both ready to abdicate their roles the instant someone offers 
them a world populated by people rather than chess pieces &#151;the outrage 
rightly felt by anyone who has had to go fruitlessly in search of a restroom 
through the crowded streets of a city, who feels in his very gut just how 
out of place human beings are in these new metropolises.</p>
<p> What we need is a new radicalism, one that can offer both the opportunity 
to make a total revolution, and the courage to seize it, to those who 
today make their revolutions only by halves: the middle-aged adulterers 
and teenage elopers, the bank robbers and shoplifters, the Peace Corps 
volunteers and block-burning rioters, religious mystics and hikers of 
the Appalachian Trail, militiamen and members of Alcoholics Anonymous, 
free software advocates and fired construction workers, and everyone else 
who has everything at stake in the formation of a new world and no idea 
how to get there. A radicalism that can join the cause of the landless 
farmworkers in Brazil to the raw fury of the dilettante anarchist vandal 
of the West, without any implications of charity work or youth reform; 
one that can demand that we surpass the oppressive role of art in this 
society, without denying or demeaning the solace the solitary adolescent 
poet finds in it. One that can give real form to the false promises of 
adventure implicit in &#147;rebellious&#148; rock music and fashion. . 
. one that can integrate the needs of the violent young hoodlum with those 
of the single mother, the art-school intellectual, and the runaway child. 
One that can integrate the &#147;violent&#148; with the &#147;non-violent&#148; 
resistance, showing that this is a false dichotomy, just like the self/other 
dichotomy&#151;and every other dichotomy.</p>

<p><b>Figure A:</b> My mother started smoking when she was thirteen. She 
calculated that she&#146;s probably spent enough money on cigarettes to 
retire early, if she had it back; but instead, we grew up with billboards 
advertising cigarettes next to our school, and now my brother smokes too. 
It&#146;s finally illegal for them to advertise cigarettes on billboards, 
so the same corporation has invested in other products, and other billboards.
