<h1>How Ethical is the Work &lsquo;Ethic&rsquo;</h1>
<h5>reconsidering work and &lsquo;leisure time&rsquo;</h5> 
<p> Did you ever wonder why your parents act so disoriented when it comes 
to &lsquo;leisure&rsquo; activities? Why they start one little hobby, and either fail 
to follow through with it or become pathologically obsessed with it... 
even though it doesn't seem to have anything to do with their lives? Maybe 
they seek to lose themselves in gardening or following the exploits of 
some basketball team. Maybe your father buys all sorts of fancy tools 
(the kind of tools many men his age have), but only uses them for a few 
days before setting them aside&mdash;and then buys a lot of skiing equipment 
the next month. Or perhaps they just spend their time trying figure out 
how to pay off the debt they owe for that wide screen television they 
spend the rest of their time watching. </p>
<p> And&mdash;have they ever been honest with you about their jobs? Do they enjoy 
them? Is their work the most fulfilling thing they could be doing, are 
they able to achieve every goal they always wanted to? Do they feel heroic 
or proud every day as they return home&mdash;or are they exhausted? Do they 
turn that wide screen television on as soon as they come in the door? 
Do they have the energy to do anything else? </p>
<p> Did you ever wonder if there might be a better way for them, for you? 
</p>
<h3>What is 'Work' Like?</h3>
<p> Because of 'division of labor', most jobs today consist of doing very 
specific tasks, over and over, with very little variety. If you are a 
dishwasher, you wash dishes: you don't get to interact with people or 
solve complicated problems very often, and you never get to leave the 
dishroom to run around in the sunlight. If you are a real estate agent, 
you never use your hands to make anything, and you spend most of your 
time thinking about market value and selling points. Even jobs that include 
a certain amount of variety can only remain interesting and challenging 
up to a point: for we work forty hours a week on average, and at least 
five out of the seven days. That's a lot of our lives to spend working. 
Work is the first thing we do on most of the days of our lives, and we 
don't get to do anything else until we've been at work for quite a while. 
When we spend most of our time and energy working on one task, or even 
ten different tasks, eventually we will feel bored and desperate for variety... 
even if we are conditioned not to realize this. </p>
<p> On top of this, because of the spread of large businesses and the consequent 
decrease in self-employment and small businesses, most of us do not have 
much voice in what our responsibilities at work will be. It is hard to 
start your own business or even find a friend or neighbor to work for. 
We often must get a job to survive in which we follow the instructions 
of a manager who probably doesn't have much more control over his job 
than we have over ours. Since we don't get to decide what we are doing, 
chances are that we will feel alienated from our work, disinterested in 
the quality of our labor; we may even feel that the projects we are working 
upon are unimportant. </p>
<p> Indeed it is easy to feel that most of the jobs available today are 
unimportant&mdash;for in a certain sense, many of them are. In a purely capitalist 
economy, the jobs that are available will be determined by which products 
are in the most demand; and often the products that are in demand (military 
technology, fast food, Pepsi, fashionable clothes) are not products that 
really make people happy. It's easy to feel like all your labor is wasted 
when the products you work so hard to sell just to survive seem to do 
nothing for the people you sell them to. How many people really are cheered 
up by the soggy french fries at McDonalds? Would they perhaps be happier 
eating a meal prepared by a friend of theirs or a chef they knew who owned 
his own cafe? </p>
<p> In short, "work" as we know it tends to make us unhappy because we do 
so much of it, because it is so repetitive, because we don't get to choose 
what we do, and because what we are doing is often not in the best interest 
of our fellow human beings. </p>
<h3>What is Leisure Time Like?</h3>
<p> We come home from these jobs exhausted from having invested all our 
time and energy in a project we may not have even been free to choose, 
and what we need most is to recover. We are emotionally and physically 
worn out, and nothing seems more natural than to sit down quietly for 
a while and watch television or read the daily paper, while we try to 
gather our strength for the next day's labor. Perhaps we try to leave 
behind our exhaustion and frustration by concentrating on some hobby or 
another; but as we are not very used to directing ourselves in the workplace 
during the day, we often don't know what we really want to do when we 
are free at home. Certainly some company or another will have some suggestions 
for us, whether we receive them from advertising or watching our neighbors; 
but chances are that this company has their profits in mind at least as 
much as our satisfaction, and we may discover that playing miniature golf 
is strangely unfulfilling. </p>
<p> Similarly, of course, we don't have much time or energy left over from 
work to consider our situation or participate in any rewarding activity 
which requires much time and energy. We don't like to think too much about 
whether we enjoy our jobs or our lives&mdash;besides, that might be depressing, 
and what can we do if we don't enjoy them, anyway? We don't have the energy 
left to enjoy art or music or books that are really challenging; we need 
our music to be soothing, our art nonthreatening, our books merely entertaining. 
</p>
<p> In fact, we come to associate having to expend effort and do things 
with our work, and associate relaxing and not doing anything with leisure 
time. So, because many of us don't like our jobs, we tend to associate 
having to do things with being unhappy, while happiness, as far as we 
ever know it, means... not doing anything. We never act for ourselves, 
because we spend our whole days acting for other people, and we think 
that acting and working hard always leads to unhappiness; our idea of 
happiness is not having to act, being on permanent vacation. </p>
<p> And this is ultimately why so many of us are so unhappy: because happiness 
is not doing nothing, happiness is acting creatively, doing things, working 
hard on things you care about. Happiness is becoming an excellent long-distance 
runner, falling in love, cooking an original recipe for people you care 
about, building a bookshelf, writing a song. There is no happiness to 
be found in merely lying on a couch&mdash;happiness is something that we must 
pursue. We are not unhappy because we have to do things, we are unhappy 
because all the things we do are things we don't care about. And because 
our jobs exhaust us and mislead us about what we want, they are the source 
of much of our unhappiness. </p>
<h3>What is the Solution?</h3>
<p> You don't have to work at those jobs, you know. It is possible to get 
by without all the Pepsi, all the expensive clothes, the wide screen television 
and the expensive interior decorating that all those paychecks go to pay 
for. You can try to start your own business doing something you care about 
(although this still involves the danger of having too little variety 
in your work), or you can try to find a job in today's marketplace (good 
luck!) that you actually enjoy... and that leaves you enough time and 
energy to do other things in your life that you also enjoy. The most important 
thing is to arrange your life so that you are doing things because you 
want to do them, not because they are profitable&mdash;otherwise, no matter 
how much money you make, you will be selling your happiness for money. 
Remember that the less money you spend, the less you will have to worry 
about getting money in the first place... and the less you will have to 
work at those dehumanizing jobs. Learn to use all your 'free' time, not 
to vegetate or spend money on entertainment, but to create things and 
accomplish things&mdash;things that no one would pay you to make or do, but 
that make your life (and perhaps the lives of others) better anyway. </p>
<p> Some will argue that the system we live within would break down if we 
all were to walk away from our jobs&mdash;so much the better. Haven't we built 
enough automobiles, enough shopping malls, enough televisions and golf 
clubs, enough fucking nuclear weapons already? Wouldn't we all be better 
off if there was a shortage of fast food and a surplus of unique home-cooked 
meals? If playing music is more rewarding than working in an assembly 
line, why do we have so few good bands and so many transistor radios? 
Of course a 'work-free' world is a dream we will probably never see come 
true; but as always, the challenge is to make this dream a part of your 
world, as much as you can&mdash;to liberate yourself from the chains of mindless 
consumerism and mind-melting employment and live a more meaningful life.
