<h1>Vanguard of the Sexual Revolution</h1>
<p>An ad hoc committee consisting of all the people at any 
given time who are having sex that either is broadening to their personal 
horizons, is socially prohibited, or takes place in a barely concealed 
public space. It often includes fresh young lovers, reckless life&#151;artist 
types, and men and women of all ages entering into unexpected affairs; 
masturbating adolescents who live with their parents are always considered 
honorary members. Conquest-seeking "libertines" are excluded on principle, 
of course. Here is the V.S.R. manifesto, composed by Nadia C. in a library 
one night when she hadn't made love for an agitating three days... or 
perhaps on a still Christmas morning after a night of passionate sex with 
a woman she had wanted for years. </p>
<h3> A call (in)to arms!</h3>
<p> Because we get to have so little honest, intimate, beautifully dangerous 
sex that they can sell us flat images of it instead. Because we spend 
so much more time contemplating these representations than having sex 
that when we do sleep together, it is more a meeting of roles than of 
individuals&#151;and not supportive or satisfying roles, at that. Because the 
most radical of us would still rather speak fancifully of total revolution 
than dare a moment of actual experimentation in a field that really matters, 
like our beds. Because as long as our own sexualities are constructed 
by the media of silence and the culture of violence, each of us is a Trojan 
horse bearing our own enemies (the values of domination and submission, 
the paralysis of fear and shame) everywhere we go. </p>
<p> It's time to stop being spectators and start being actors (or agents, 
if you prefer, the double meaning being very much intended), to take our 
desires back by converting our sex lives from passive recreation into 
active re-creation. And to do this, we must first replace the representations 
of sex in our lives and all around us with real sex. </p>
<p> Our numbers are greater than you think. You are one of us each time 
you transform "public" space&#151;not by "privatizing" it [it's already deprived 
of anything personal at all, thus the irony that the "public" is actually 
the least public of spaces], but by making it into real people space, 
by doing something in it that truly feels liberating... for example, fucking 
(on the roof of the police station, at the shore on the rocks just below 
the art museum window, etc.). Not that public sex is always itself revolutionary 
sex, but such sex is always revolutionary in that it takes lovemaking 
out of the narrow confines in which it is permitted&#151;that is, in which 
it is permitted to languish, caged and stripped of the spontaneity that 
is its life's blood, just as we languish with the rest of the world stripped 
of it. </p>
<p> They shall know us by the innocence of our guilty smiles, holding hands 
as we walk out of the fog in parks at night: transformed and transcendent, 
unbowed and uninhibited in this dry and dreamless world&#151;by used birth

classrooms and office bathrooms&#151;by growing numbers of women who know exactly 
what they want and men who aren't afraid to touch one another. We will 
be the spark that ignites the new sexual revolution: armies of lovers 
laying down their responsibilities and picking up each other, as weapons, 
to fight against the smothering joylessness of this world. To quote the 
skinheads' anthem of homophobia and intolerance back at them, we refuse 
to "stay in the closet because it's safe in there"&#151;precisely for that 
reason! As we've learned time and again in this struggle, our only safety 
is in danger. </p>

and a world of pleasure to win!</h5>
