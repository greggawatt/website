<h1>Under 
the Helicopters</h1>
<h5>An eyewitness account of the CrimethInc. 
barnstorming tours convergence, the attendant media and 
police witch-hunt, and the usual triumph of anarchy against 
insurmountable odds.</h5>
<p> <em>August 
5 through 10, 2003, a gathering of touring theater troupes 
loosely associated with the radical publishing collective 
CrimethInc. took place around and within Louisville, Kentucky.<br>
</em></p><p>No, 
that&#8217;s no way to begin. Fuck the dry A.P. press release 
tone, this has to really grab people, convey what it was 
like to be there&#8212;it should put readers in our shoes, 
not just &#8220;inform&#8221; them, as if it was possible 
to do so in an impartial manner in the first place. Maybe 
we could start in medias res, at the high point of the action:</p><p><em>The 
roar of the helicopter grew deafening as it circled lower 
around the house, the searchlight scouring the walls outside. 
Our host clasped her baby closer to her breast; we all shuddered. 
At that moment, the wail of a siren, the very sound we&#8217;d 
been fearing since the pigs had closed their siege around 
our campsite, rose from the direction of the road&#8212;the 
waiting was over, they were closing in for the kill. My 
companion took me aside: &#8220;What are we going to do 
about the laptop? Should we destroy it, rather than let 
it fall into their hands?&#8221;</em></p><p>But 
I can&#8217;t do that quite the way I&#8217;d like to, either. 
While the court cases are still pending and the investigations 
in progress, who&#8217;s to know what details are safe to 
divulge? That&#8217;s one of the greatest tragedies of living 
in revolt: you can never speak openly about the most important 
things in your life without a look over your shoulder and 
a trembling thought as to who might be listening in. Think 
of all the beautiful stories we&#8217;ll have for each other, 
all the exploits we&#8217;ll brag of when capitalism finally 
falls! In the meantime, danger keeps our lips shut, and 
all too often our sagas die with us. That&#8217;s the greatest 
advantage our enemies have&#8212;the further we go in our 
resistance, the less we can tell our stories, the less we 
can share what we learn and suffer and achieve, while even 
the murderers among them can talk freely and without fear, 
as if they have nothing to be ashamed of.</p><p>And 
so however afraid we are, we still must speak, we still 
must share everything we can without doing their surveillance 
work for them. For me, the primary lesson of our experience 
in Louisville was that we can&#8217;t let ourselves be intimidated&#8212;the 
more we come under attack, the more vocal we must be. Security 
culture is more necessary than ever today, but misunderstood 
as a code of silence it can only defeat us. As the showdown 
between power and people intensifies, only more visibility 
can save us&#8212;less will just make it easier for them 
to pack us off to the concentration camps one by one. So 
here, censored as little as possible (but without any further 
references to laptop computers, or other, shall we say, 
red herrings), follows the short version of what transpired 
that crazy week in Kentucky. For the juicy, tell-all version, 
catch me warming my hands at the last burning barricade 
on the final day of judgment&#8212;I&#8217;ll be thrilled 
to fill you in.</p><p>We 
arrived at the convergence site, a private farm outside 
Louisville, Kentucky, at the end of a long road of alternating 
catastrophes and miracles. We had seen our van die a bitter 
death and our replacement vehicle break down, leaving five 
of us crowded into a tiny pickup truck with a van&#8217;s 
worth of gear; we had performed everywhere from a rural 
intentional community to a teen center, had gone swimming 
in a lake improbably owned by a high-ranking politician, 
and seen a spontaneous anarchist street march break out 
and meet with police repression; on one occasion, we had 
stayed up all night bailing our companions out of jail, 
only to pack up and depart at dawn. Shellshocked as we were, 
we didn&#8217;t dare expect the convergence to be more than 
a handful of us sitting around a campfire&#8212;so you can 
imagine how overjoyed we were to be greeted by a well-organized 
welcome center at the entrance!</p><p>We 
embraced our friends, old and new, and were just about to 
drive in when another vehicle appeared from down an adjoining 
driveway, speeding and swerving and kicking up gravel. Emblazoned 
on its side was a logo: Channel 11 News. Our friends were 
chasing it, running to cut it off, shouting at us to get 
ahead of it; we gunned our engine and sped forward, blocking 
its path. From inside two angry and self-righteous journalists 
were shouting accusations and demands at our friends, threatening 
to call the police if they were not admitted; our friends, 
covering their faces, adamantly insisted that they leave 
immediately, until finally the car turned and drove away. 
At the time, we thought this was just a freak occurrence, 
but it proved to be an ominous indication of what was to 
come.<br>
We spent the first night catching up with our old comrades, 
exchanging accounts of the tangled trails and trials that 
had brought us there. There were just shy of one hundred 
of us on the campsite, though I&#8217;m afraid that, somewhat 
more than last summer, the proportions favored individuals 
that had showed up for the event alone over groups arriving 
from tours. All the same, it was a choice bunch&#8212;some 
of the cleverest, freest, sweetest people I&#8217;ve had 
the good fortune to see assembled.</p><p>The 
next day, we met in a great circle to decide what our plans 
for the week would be, and that was when the first helicopter 
flew overhead. It was a news helicopter; the bastards, refused 
entry to our campsite and denied interviews with our number, 
had spent quite a sum to get (what we later saw to be blurry, 
unimpressive) footage of us from the air. We were outraged, 
of course, and some of us taunted the occupants of the machine 
as it circled us three times, but after it was gone we got 
back to the business of digging latrines, writing schedules, 
and preparing meals.</p><p>The 
helicopters continued over the next couple days: Fox News, 
Channel 11, other local channels, and a couple that were&#8212;this 
was somewhat more troubling&#8212;unmarked. We learned to 
ignore them as best we could while getting on with our affairs: 
sharing skills from across the anarchist spectrum, planning 
and networking for projects and actions to come, entertaining 
each other with brilliant routines and inventions&#8212;for 
example, one of our number demonstrated a mobile musical 
suit he had constructed, which would blast beats from speakers 
on his body while he freestyled effortlessly along in, say, 
a supermarket; others had driven from Alaska in a school 
bus converted into a mobile home, which was inspiring just 
to explore, let alone join in decorating with stencils. 
In those two days, we accomplished a lot of the goals we 
had in mind for the convergence&#8212;which turned out to 
be fortunate, as events were about to develop in an entirely 
unexpected direction.</p><p>At 
a dinner meeting called to discuss our plans for downtown 
Louisville the following day&#8212;a low-intensity demonstration 
to call attention to the corporations that were polluting 
its land and exploiting its people&#8212;we got word from 
friends in the city that we had just been on the news. Not 
only had we been on the news, but, according to the rumors, 
the headline item at five o&#8217;clock had been that an 
army of dangerous anarchists was congregating outside of 
Louisville and preparing to attack&#8212;but that, not to 
worry, unbeknownst to them the police had them surrounded 
and were about to sweep in to foil their plans. Supposedly, 
the television news story even concluded with footage of 
police crouched in hiding places, lying in wait! Of course, 
as we joked then, unless they (rightly!) guessed we were 
some of the only people in the city without access to or 
interest in television, the stuff about the police preparing 
to surprise us was mere sensationalism and scare tactics&#8212;but 
all the same it was hard not to be a little shaken up. As 
night fell, some of us got together at the house owned by 
the family hosting us, to compose a communiqu&eacute; to 
our communities about the harassment. It was there that 
this first chapter of the convergence reached its tumultuous 
climax.</p><p>In 
the middle of our discussion, the eleven o&#8217;clock news 
came on, and, temporarily breaking our ban on mainstream 
propaganda out of tactical necessity, we went to watch it. 
Yes indeed, we were the first item on every news channel 
at the top of the hour. There was blurry helicopter footage 
of us at the campsite, and the announcer referenced the 
episode in Columbia, Missouri in which a &#8220;flash mob&#8221; 
covered a federal building in graffiti and burned its flags 
as an example of what CrimethInc. was all about&#8212;and 
why law-abiding citizens had to be protected from us. As 
for what actually happened in Columbia, for now I&#8217;ll 
leave that to the mainstream media to report (see the example 
at the conclusion of this piece for starters), but it had 
apparently got law enforcement agents and network media 
in quite a tizzy. Also, verifying the earlier rumors, the 
announcer reported that police had occupied the neighboring 
lands: we were surrounded.</p><p>It 
was time to work out how to handle the situation. We were 
on private land, so they hadn&#8217;t been able to come 
in yet, but it seemed clear that the police and media were 
working to create an atmosphere in which the public would 
feel that repression of us &#8220;dangerous outsiders&#8221; 
was justified. I&#8217;ve long known that the mainstream 
media are basically police with cameras for guns, but I&#8217;d 
never been on the business end of them quite as explicitly 
as this. I was a little vexed about it&#8212;I&#8217;m not 
one of those anarchists who needs to provoke repression 
to feel that my politics count as revolutionary; I&#8217;ve 
always felt myself most effective flying under the radar, 
and prided myself on being good at staying there. Now we 
were locked in a standoff with the pigs without the masses 
anywhere in sight, like we were the Eugene Anarchists or 
something. How embarrassing!</p><p>Before 
we got far into figuring out what to do if we were invaded, 
a frantic report arrived from the welcome center: the car 
we had sent out to dumpster food had been stopped and the 
occupants harassed, and the police had now set up a checkpoint 
at the end of the one road leading out of the campsite&#8212;two 
police cars and a special &#8220;Investigational Services&#8221; 
vehicle. This was the opportune moment that the police helicopter 
appeared over the farm, armed with a scorching white searchlight 
and circling low. It seemed to us that this was either a 
particularly high-intensity intimidation tactic, or an indication 
that they were casing the campsite for an imminent incursion. 
Had the police sirens not begun in the distance a minute 
later, we might have been able to take the time to puzzle 
out just how seriously to take their swaggering; but once 
they started up, we moved on to planning how to evacuate 
the individuals and items in our midst that most needed 
to be kept out of the hands of our enemies.</p><p>We 
were later to find out that we were being more uptight than 
our friends; the kids on the other side of the farm, never 
ones to take anything less lightly than need be, paused 
in their open mic circle to dance in the searchlight, chased 
after it when it moved on, and one level-headed fellow even 
used his digital camera to catch some hilarious footage 
of this spectacle. It was tense in that kitchen, though: 
with our host&#8217;s civilian mother talking about which 
of our communications were tapped, the steady roar of the 
helicopter overhead, and the stress of figuring out under 
duress exactly what we needed to do to minimize the impact 
of an invasion, it felt a little like we were inside the 
next Waco.</p><p>The 
police never did close in; the siren wailed for a little 
while, and then was silent again. All the same, we put the 
process in motion to get endangered people out&#8212;starting 
with a few space monkeys to test the waters, then moving 
on to the ones in really precarious positions, utilizing 
a complex system of code to receive reports at the house 
as to how each expedition went. By dawn we had finished. 
Looking back, it seems really unlikely that they were actually 
prepared to raid us&#8212;such an undertaking would have 
cost them more police and preparation than they could possibly 
have mobilized on such short order; all the same, the harassment 
was becoming so distracting that, had we stayed, we would 
have been badly distracted from everything we needed to 
focus on.</p><p>We 
woke up the next day at various houses in Louisville proper, 
extremely exhausted. We were soon joined by the remainder 
of our number from the campsite&#8212;that morning, our 
hosts had supposedly received word in no uncertain terms 
that the farm was in fact going to be raided, and everyone 
had departed accordingly. Oblique references were even made 
to federal agents, who had supposedly been going to find 
bomb-making materials on our site. Yeah, yeah&#8212;you 
morons find bomb-making materials everywhere you raid, at 
least until your claims have to stand up in court.</p><p>Now 
began the difficult process of regrouping a bunch of freaked 
out people and deciding what to do next. Our planned event 
of the day, the protest in the financial sector, was called 
off, for a variety of reasons: people were afraid the police 
would take advantage of it to pick us off, that the security 
in organizing it hadn&#8217;t been tight enough, that we 
didn&#8217;t have a clear enough idea of what we were doing 
there. This was disappointing to the people who had been 
preparing for it, and reinforced the dynamic that we out-of-towners 
were coming in and depleting local resources without contributing 
to local struggles&#8212;and, for that matter, gave positive 
reinforcement to the cops for the scare tactics they&#8217;d 
been using, assuming they did know we had planned a protest; 
but with so many people still afraid, and the organizers 
having failed to inspire broad-based confidence in their 
plan, there was nothing for it but to cancel.</p><p>There 
was some discussion as to whether we dared act as a group 
in public at all after the media smear campaign that presumably 
had the whole populace thinking we were terrorists&#8212;and 
for that matter, how safe were we in these houses? did we 
dare even talk over the telephone?&#8212;but it was decided 
that the worst thing we could do would be to let them intimidate 
us into silence and invisibility. For our first tentative 
foray into public, we chose an art car show down the street 
from the site of the originally planned protest&#8212;we 
reasoned that the presence of presumably liberal art-lovers 
and artists would be a deterrent to serious police repression, 
and figured we&#8217;d be in our element among another creative 
fringe group, albeit car enthusiasts.</p><p>We 
showed up in small groups, and established a presence in 
the middle of the on-street exhibition: an anarchic orchestra 
that could be heard for blocks playing a variety of home-made 
instruments and found-object percussion, stilt-walkers making 
balloon animals for children and encouraging them to join 
in the chalk-decorating of the sidewalk, the omnipresent 
free literature table, and a number of us walking around 
starting conversations with the locals about the events 
of the past days and the ways they connected with local 
issues. Some of us had contacted the media to try to set 
things straight, but, revealing their true colors, now that 
they&#8217;d secured their ratings with alarmist, sensationalist 
tripe they didn&#8217;t even bother to show up. The police 
did show up, however&#8212;first a single patrol car, then 
a number of them, including unmarked cars. In the process 
of monitoring them, I met a lovely old homeless guy, who, 
it turned out, had been running volunteer surveillance on 
them on our behalf already: &#8220;That&#8217;s an unmarked 
car right there, I know that guy&#8212;he arrested me twice. 
Don&#8217;t worry, he won&#8217;t do shit unless his boss 
tells him to. You kids are good people, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re 
here.&#8221; At that moment, I felt grateful again for the 
open wounds on my hands, the tangles in my hair, the dirt 
on my clothes, which had only seemed like liabilities over 
the preceding days when at any moment I might have had to 
pass for a civilian: these were signifiers connecting me 
to an entire world of other marginalized peoples, folks 
with the same natural enemies and longings.</p><p>And 
as it turned out, at the very moment that the police were 
assessing the situation, the organizer of the show was talking 
to one of us&#8212;expressing gratitude to us for showing 
up and enhancing the exhibition! She invited us to a parade 
they were holding through downtown Louisville the next day. 
Then, when the police approached to mess with us, she intervened, 
informing them that we were part of the event and not to 
be bullied. A long argument ensued, at the conclusion of 
which the police officers departed in frustration, leaving 
only a single car to circle the block.</p><p>From 
the exhibition, we headed to Bardstown Road, the main commercial 
drag in Louisville. It was Friday night, and the district 
was crowded with bored teenagers hanging around, hip young 
professionals going clubbing, and older folks dining out. 
We began a parade up and down the road, complete with marching 
drums, singing, outlandish costumes, and runners giving 
out free food easily dumpstered from behind local establishments, 
much to the merriment of all. At the outset, there were 
perhaps less than fifty of us, but that number swiftly doubled 
as more and more passers by joined in off the street. We 
even came across a couple backpackers who had just hitchhiked 
into town in search of us. The police kept tabs on us, but 
again, under the eyes of a wide public, were unable to do 
more. Passing drivers honked and cheered, a surf band performing 
at a nearby nightclub came to join us with their great gong 
in tow, shouting out their own quirky versions of Seattle 
protest chants, and there was joy in the air as the urban 
environment everyone had taken for granted was transformed. 
At the end of our second circuit we quickly dispersed, and 
though some of us were followed by police we all managed 
to lose them.<br>
Asking directions back to the neighborhood where we were 
staying, my friends and I had the most inspiring experience 
of the week. The middle-aged, lower-middle-class couple 
we accosted gladly directed us, then engaged us in conversation:</p><p>&#8220;Did 
you make that [impressive homemade musical instrument] on 
top of your [vehicle]?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yeah, 
it&#8217;s the fourth one I did, the first one that&#8217;s 
really audible.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Are 
you all from around here?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;No, 
we&#8217;re visiting. We were staying on a farm outside 
town, but&#8212;&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Oh 
my god, you are! Are you&#8212;THE ANARCHISTS?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Uh, 
yeah, but&#8212;&#8221;</p><p>The 
woman, practically jumping up and down: &#8220;We saw you 
on TV! You guys are great!&#8221;</p><p>Us: 
?!?!!</p><p>&#8220;Do 
you do graffiti, write on walls, things like that?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Um, 
no, we&#8217;re not really about&#8212;&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;&#8212;because 
I have to say, I love some of the stuff I see. I even do 
a bit myself!&#8221;</p><p>I 
break in here, over my nervous friend: &#8220;Well, maybe 
just a little&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t 
let them scare you with their bullshit, OK? Don&#8217;t 
let them get you!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yeah, 
that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying! Don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;re 
gonna get them!&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yeah, 
that&#8217;s right!&#8221;</p><p>We 
drove off shouting and laughing and waving to our new friends, 
and at that moment it dawned on me&#8212;all those people 
that had joined in our parade that night, that had honked 
and waved or come out of the restaurants to watch us go 
by, they had all seen the news coverage of us, and they 
didn&#8217;t buy it, they didn&#8217;t care. If the networks 
said we were monsters bent on the destruction of everything 
America holds sacred, that just made us more interesting 
to them. Our enemies had brought out the big guns to discredit 
us, and it hadn&#8217;t been enough.</p><p>I 
returned to our safehouse ecstatic, and spent the next hours 
dancing wildly to the soundtrack of Natural Born Killers, 
pausing to engage my friends in impassioned conversation 
about the implications of the evening&#8217;s events: &#8220;We 
were right to come out of the closet about wanting to smash 
capitalism and so on&#8212;we aren&#8217;t isolated, there 
are millions of us! All it&#8217;s gonna take is for some 
of us to get together and say it&#8217;s on, and it will 
be!&#8221;</p><p>The 
next day, we showed up at noon and filled the streets in 
the middle of the art-car parade, once again with drums 
and banners and free food. It turned out we were parading 
down the same route we had the night before. There was a 
problem with someone&#8217;s engine ahead&#8212;it would 
overheat if they drove too slowly&#8212;so the cars forward 
of us ended up driving quickly on, leaving us fronting the 
rest of the parade. Without really meaning to, we led the 
main body of the parade off its permitted route, along the 
commercial thoroughfare once again, to cheers and clapping 
from the sidewalks. Eventually a police officer, his hands 
full trying to supervise traffic, showed up to direct the 
drivers back to their route, and we were left alone, still 
occupying the street. We eventually regrouped in the parking 
lot where the art-cars had gathered for one more exhibition, 
and established a presence there as we had the day before, 
giving out massive quantities of literature and engaging 
in numerous conversations with locals about the police, 
the media, and the possibility of another world. Throughout 
everything, we felt exceptionally well-received by the citizens 
of Louisville, excepting the police, of course.</p><p>That 
night was the show for the barnstorming tour groups, which 
had been clumsily attached to a local punk rock benefit 
show. This was another trying, awkward situation: there 
had been some trouble with the show, only partly owing to 
our involvement in it and the subsequent attention it had 
received, and it had been moved over and over from venue 
to venue&#8212;finally coming to rest in a suburban family&#8217;s 
basement. We set up our literature table, started some good 
conversations and so on, but it soon became apparent that 
the hosts weren&#8217;t interested in making it possible 
for us to participate after all. Still hoping to make something 
of a difficult night, we scrambled to find another venue, 
and eventually relocated everyone to another house. Exhausted 
but buoyed by the feeling of being among friends, the various 
remainders of the barnstorming groups showed off some of 
the agitational performances they had been doing around 
the country, to much rejoicing. The show ended up being 
mostly for us, the &#8220;converted,&#8221; but it was still 
important that it happened under the circumstances, as an 
affirmation of our indomitable determination&#8212;and I 
think all of us there knew that the real deal is to get 
our artwork and activity out of the radical ghetto and into 
the public arena, whenever it is possible.</p><p>
On the final day, ready to take it easy, the remnants of 
our group gathered at a popular Louisville park known for 
its unlicensed swimming. In the Fellini version of our story, 
the movie ends there, the camera panning from the &#8220;NO 
WADING&#8212;NO SWIMMING&#8221; signs to the fountains overflowing 
with laughing people of all ages and backgrounds&#8212;the 
everyday anarchists, taking their rights by storm without 
need of a manifesto for justification, the ones we can count 
on to ensure the success of the revolution once we manage 
to set its wheels in motion. When you&#8217;re a revolutionary, 
of course, real life is always better than any movie, and 
so we still had time afterwards to hold a dumpstering and 
cooking competition that culminated in a great feast and 
dance party. It was not exactly confrontational politics, 
but we felt we&#8217;d earned the right to &#8220;indulge 
our desires&#8221; (as the straw men in the anti-CrimethInc. 
myths and rumors always do&#8212;boy, must they live high 
on the hog!) a bit after the harrowing situations of the 
previous days.</p><p>We 
exchanged contacts and oaths that we would meet again for 
further adventures, one of our number made one more useless 
attempt to contact the media (which was rewarded with a 
helicopter visit to our safehouse, absurdly enough), and 
we were on our way to the next stop in tour&#8212;where 
we found the police waiting for us, once again. But that&#8217;s 
another story!</p><p>So 
what worked this summer, and what didn&#8217;t? Let me say 
this, first&#8212;our enemies fucked up royally by threatening 
us without following through. Being in a situation like 
that is intensely frightening&#8212;not that I haven&#8217;t 
been under helicopters and surrounded by police over and 
over at demonstrations and so on, but this was the first 
time I&#8217;d experienced them coming for us&#8212;but 
next time it happens, I&#8217;ll be calm and collected: 
&#8220;Sure, we&#8217;re under siege and they&#8217;re preparing 
to attack, but last time this happened everything worked 
out. Keep cool but don&#8217;t freeze, as my friend always 
says.&#8221; Any time they give us the benefit of a practice 
run without the usual costs, it&#8217;s a gift&#8212;it&#8217;s 
not easy to get field practice being an embattled revolutionary! 
Being able to gauge actual levels of risk and resist intimidation 
tactics is important, and now a hundred of us are better 
equipped to do so.</p><p>And 
despite everything, we did accomplish the greater part of 
our goals in converging: skills and ideas were exchanged, 
plans were laid, some crazy adventures of the kind you can&#8217;t 
organize in advance took place, a little more visibility 
for the anarchist perspective was achieved (and a few more 
crazy stories entered circulation), and, perhaps most importantly, 
the bonds of existing and new relationships were forged 
in fire, to stand us in good stead in the future. In addition, 
we did reclaim a couple streets, our hosts and some others 
to experienced firsthand what the police state is like in 
action (a radicalizing experience if there ever was one!), 
and we got away without a single arrest during the whole 
week, despite intensive surveillance and the fact that perhaps 
more than half of our number were career criminals of some 
kind or another.</p><p>Things 
that could have been done better? There are some obvious 
ones. This year&#8217;s format certainly didn&#8217;t do 
much to enable the participation of anyone from outside 
the traveler-kid cultural context, that&#8217;s for sure. 
And I think the witch-hunt could have been fended off early 
on if an experienced group had been doing police and media 
liaison work&#8212;those of us experienced enough to do 
so were unprepared and already overworked. The fact is&#8212;as 
much as we can turn the experience to our advantage&#8212;they 
did succeed in intimidating us, and we should have been 
able to resist such tactics. If the local organizers and 
the organizers of the barnstorming groups, especially the 
ones with the most previous experience in such situations, 
had worked more closely together in advance of the gathering, 
we would have been much better equipped to deal with such 
crises, and could then have concentrated our energy on precipitating 
crises for our foes rather than coping with them ourselves. 
Hell, things can always benefit from being better organized&#8212;there&#8217;s

enough about the past&#8212;let&#8217;s get out there and 
put these lessons to use. No longer particularly impressed

&#8220;One must always aim to act in the full light of day, 
bearing in mind that the best way to obtain a freedom is 
to take it, facing the necessary risks; very often a freedom 
is lost, through one&#8217;s own fault, either through not 
exercising it or using it timidly, giving the impression 
that one does not have the right to be doing what one is 
doing.&#8221;<br>
