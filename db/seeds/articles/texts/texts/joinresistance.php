<p align="center"><img src="http://thecloud.crimethinc.com/images/love/1a.jpg" alt="Join the Resistance: Fall in Love" width="500" height="143"></p> 
<p> Falling in love is the ultimate act of revolution, of resistance to 
today's tedious, socially restrictive, culturally constrictive, humanly 
meaningless world. </p>
<p> Love transforms the world. Where the lover formerly felt boredom, he 
now feels passion. Where she once was complacent, she now is excited and 
compelled to self-asserting action. The world which once seemed empty 
and tiresome becomes filled with meaning, filled with risks and rewards, 
with majesty and danger. Life for the lover is a gift, an adventure with 
the highest possible stakes; every moment is memorable, heartbreaking 
in its fleeting beauty. When he falls in love, a man who once felt disoriented, 
alienated, and confused will know exactly what he wants. Suddenly his 
existence will make sense to him; suddenly it becomes valuable, even glorious 
and noble, to him. Burning passion is an antidote that will cure the worst 
cases of despair and resigned obedience. </p>
<p> Love makes it possible for individuals to connect to others in a meaningful 
way&#151;it impels them to leave their shells and risk being honest and spontaneous 
together, to come to know each other in profound ways. Thus love makes 
it possible for them to care about each other genuinely, rather than at 
the end of the gun of Christian doctrine. But at the same time, it plucks 
the lover out of the routines of everyday life and separates her from 
other human beings. She will feel a million miles away from the herd of 
humanity, living as she is in a world entirely different from theirs. 
</p>
<p> In this sense love is subversive, because it poses a threat to the established 
order of our modern lives. The boring rituals of workday productivity 
and socialized etiquette will no longer mean anything to a man who has 
fallen in love, for there are more important forces guiding him than mere 
inertia and deference to tradition. Marketing strategies that depend upon 
apathy or insecurity to sell the products that keep the economy running 
as it does will have no effect upon him. Entertainment designed for passive 
consumption, which depends upon exhaustion or cynicism in the viewer, 
will not interest him. </p>

<p> There is no place for the passionate, romantic lover in today's world, 
business or private. For he can see that it might be more worthwhile to 
hitchhike to Alaska (or to sit in the park and watch the clouds sail by) 
with his sweetheart than to study for his calculus exam or sell real estate, 
and if he decides that it is, he will have the courage to do it rather 
than be tormented by unsatisfied longing. He knows that breaking into 
a cemetery and making love under the stars will make for a much more memorable 
night than watching television ever could. So love poses a threat to our 
consumer-driven economy, which depends upon consumption of (largely useless) 
products and the labor that this consumption necessitates to perpetuate 
itself. </p>
<p> Similarly, love poses a threat to our political system, for it is difficult 
to convince a man who has a lot to live for in his personal relationships 
to be willing to fight and die for an abstraction such as the state; for 
that matter, it may be difficult to convince him to even pay taxes. It 
poses a threat to cultures of all kinds, for when human beings are given 
wisdom and valor by true love they will not be held back by traditions 
or customs which are irrelevant to the feelings that guide them. </p>
<p> Love even poses a threat to our society itself. Passionate love is ignored 
and feared by the bourgeoisie, for it poses a great danger to the stability 
and pretense they covet. Love permits no lies, no falsehoods, not even 
any polite half-truths, but lays all emotions bare and reveals secrets 
which domesticated men and women cannot bear. You cannot lie with your 
emotional and sexual response; situations or ideas will excite or repel 
you whether you like it or not, whether it is polite or not, whether it 
is advisable or not. One cannot be a lover and a (dreadfully) responsible, 
(dreadfully) respectable member of today's society at the same time; for 
love will impel you to do things which are not "responsible" or "respectable." 
True love is irresponsible, irrepressible, rebellious, scornful of cowardice, 
dangerous to the lover and everyone around her, for it serves one master 
alone: the passion that makes the human heart beat faster. It disdains 
anything else, be it self-preservation, obedience, or shame. Love urges 
men and women to heroism, and to antiheroism&#151;to indefensible acts that 
need no defense for the one who loves. </p>

<p> For the lover speaks a different moral and emotional language than the 
typical bourgeois man does. The average bourgeois man has no overwhelming, 
smoldering desires. Sadly, all he knows is the silent despair that comes 
of spending his life pursuing goals set for him by his family, his educators, 
his employers, his nation, and his culture, without ever being able to 
even consider what needs and wants he might have of his own. Without the 
burning fire of desire to guide him, he has no criteria upon which to 
choose what is right and wrong for himself. Consequently he is forced 
to adopt some dogma or doctrine to direct him through his life. There 
are a wide variety of moralities to choose from in the marketplace of 
ideas, but which morality a man buys into is immaterial so long as he 
chooses one because he is at a loss otherwise as to what he should do 
with himself and his life. How many men and women, having never realized 
that they had the option to choose their own destinies, wander through 
life in a dull haze thinking and acting in accordance with the laws that 
have been taught to them, merely because they no longer have any other 
idea of what to do? But the lover needs no prefabricated principles to 
direct her; her desires identify what is right and wrong for her, for 
her heart guides her through life. She sees beauty and meaning in the 
world, because her desires paint the world in these colors. She has no 
need for dogmas, for moral systems, for commandments and imperatives, 
for she knows what to do without instructions. </p>
<p> Thus she does indeed pose quite a threat to our society. What if everyone 
decided right and wrong for themselves, without any regard for conventional 
morality? What if everyone did whatever they wanted to, with the courage 
to face any consequences? What if everyone feared loveless, lifeless monotony 
more than they fear taking risks, more than they fear being hungry or 
cold or in danger? What if everyone set down their "responsibilities" 
and "common sense," and dared to pursue their wildest dreams, to set the 
stakes high and live each day as if it were the last? Think what a place 
the world would be! Certainly it would be different than it is now&#151;and 
it is quite a truism that people from the "mainstream," the simultaneous 
keepers and victims of the status quo, fear change. </p>

<p> And so, despite the stereotyped images used in the media to sell toothpaste 
and honeymoon suites, genuine passionate love is discouraged in our culture. 
Being "carried away by your emotions" is frowned upon; instead we are 
raised to always be on our guard lest our hearts lead us astray. Rather 
than being encouraged to have the courage to face the consequences of 
risks taken in pursuit of our hearts' desires, we are counseled not to 
take risks at all, to be "responsible." And love itself is regulated. 
Men must not fall in love with other men, nor women with other women, 
nor individuals from different ethnic backgrounds with each other, or 
else the usual bigots who form the front-line offensive in the assault 
of modern Western culture upon the individual will step in. Men and women 
who have already entered into a legal/religious contract with each other 
are not to fall in love with anyone else, even if they no longer feel 
any passion for their marital partner. Love as most of us know it today 
is a carefully prescribed and preordained ritual, something that happens 
on Friday nights in expensive movie theaters and restaurants, something 
that fills the pockets of the shareholders in the entertainment industries 
without preventing workers from showing up to the office on time and ready 
to reroute phone calls all day long. This regulated, commercial "love" 
is nothing like the passionate, burning love that consumes the genuine 
lover. These restrictions, expectations, and regulations smother true 
love; for love is a wild flower that can never grow within the confines 
prepared for it but only appears where it is least expected. </p>
<p> We must fight against these cultural restraints that would cripple and 
smother our desires. For it is love that gives meaning to life, desire 
that makes it possible for us to make sense of our existence and find 
purpose in our lives. Without these, there is no way for us to determine 
how to live our lives, except to submit to some authority, to some god, 
master or doctrine that will tell us what to do and how to do it without 
ever giving us the satisfaction that self-determination does. So fall 
in love today, with men, with women, with music, with ambition, with yourself. 
. . with life! </p>

<p><em>One might say that it is ridiculous to implore others to fall in love&#151;one 
either falls in love or one does not, it is not a choice that can be made 
consciously. Emotions do not follow the instructions of the rational mind. 
But the environment in which we must live out our lives has a great influence 
on our emotions, and we can make rational decisions that will affect this 
environment. It should be possible to work to change an environment that 
is hostile to love into an environment that will encourage it. Our task 
must be to engineer our world so that it is a world in which people can 
and do fall in love, and thus to reconstitute human beings so that we 
will be ready for the "revolution" spoken of in these pages&#151;so that we 
will be able to find meaning and happiness in our lives.</em> </p>
