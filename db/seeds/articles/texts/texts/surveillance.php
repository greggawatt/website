<h1>You Are Under Surveillance</h1>
<p>Public 
space is increasingly policed by hidden surveillance systems. 
The private life of the individual is secretly captured, 
mapped, collected, and owned in effigy by a cabal of private 
business operations&#8212;the security industry.</p>
<p> 
Ironically, as communities disintegrate and more and more 
of us find ourselves lost in a faceless mass of consumers, 
the only ones we can count on to interest themselves in 
our lives are the enforcers of the laws that govern spaces 
designated for consumption. Reclaiming space from surveillance 
would reinforce our freedom to act privately, for ourselves 
and each other rather than the cameras, and thus enable 
us to come together out of our anonymity. We&#8217;ve had 
our fifteen minutes of fame&#8212;now point that thing somewhere 
else!</p>
<p> 
Such oppressive security measures are only necessary when 
wealth and power are distributed so unfairly that human 
beings cannot coexist in peace. The ones who oversee these 
security systems are mistaken when they claim that order 
must be established to clear the way for liberty and equality. 
The opposite is true: order is only possible as a consequence 
of people living together with freedom, equality, and justice 
for all. Anything else is simply repression. If cameras 
are necessary on every corner, then something is fundamentally 
wrong in our society, and getting rid of the cameras is 
as good a starting place as any.</p>
<p> 
As a culture, we are preoccupied with observation, images, 
spectatorship. Now internet advertisements offer consumers 
spy cameras and hidden microphones of our own, completing 
the three steps to panopticon: we watch monitors, we are 
monitored, we become our own monitors. But when the distinction 
between observer and observed is dissolved, we do not regain 
wholeness&#8212;on the contrary, we find we have been trapped 
outside ourselves, alienated in the most fundamental sense.</p>
<p> 
Here&#8217;s a quixotic project&#8212;get together with 
your friends and disable all the security cameras in your 
city, declaring it a free action zone. You know what they 
say about dancing like nobody&#8217;s watching.</p>

<h3><em>What&#8217;s 
So Bad About Video Surveillance?</em></h3>
<p> 
The past several years have seen a dramatic increase in 
closed circuit television camera surveillance of public 
space. Video cameras peer at us from the sides of buildings, 
from ATM machines, from traffic lights, capturing our every 
move for observation by police officers and private security 
guards. The effectiveness of these devices in reducing crime 
is dubious at best, and cases of misuse by public and private 
authorities have raised serious concerns about video monitoring 
in public space.</p>
<p> These are a few examples of people who might legitimately 
want to avoid having their picture taken by unseen observers:</p>
<h4>Minorities</h4>
<p> One of the big problems with video surveillance is the tendency 
of police officers and security guards to single out particular 
people for monitoring. It is hardly surprising that the 
mentality that produced racial profiling in traffic stops 
has found similar expression in police officers focusing 
their cameras on people of color. A study of video surveillance 
in the UK, the leading user of CCTV surveillance systems, 
revealed that &#8220;black people were between one-and-a-half 
and two-and-a-half times more likely to be surveilled than 
one would expect from their presence in the population.&#8221; 
It is worth pointing out that, in this study, 40% of people 
that the police targeted were picked out &#8220;for no obvious 
reason,&#8221; other than their ethnicity or apparent membership 
in subcultural groups. In other words, they were singled 
out not for what they were doing, but for the way they looked 
alone.</p>
<h4> 
Women</h4>
<p>Police monitors can&#8217;t seem to keep it in their pants 
when it comes to video surveillance. In a Hull University 
study, 1 out of 10 women were targeted for &#8220;voyeuristic&#8221; 
reasons by male camera operators, and a Brooklyn police 
sergeant blew the whistle on several of her colleagues in 
1998 for &#8220;taking pictures of civilian women in the 
area&#8230; from breast shots to the backside.&#8221;</p>
<h4> 
Youth</h4>
<p>Young men, particularly young black men, are routinely singled 
out by police operators for increased scrutiny. This is 
particularly true if they appear to belong to subcultural 
groups that authority figures find suspicious or threatening. 
Do you wear baggy pants or shave your head? Smile&#8212;you&#8217;re 
on candid camera!</p>
<h4> 
Outsiders</h4>
<p>The Hull University study also found a tendency of CCTV 
operators to focus on people whose appearance or activities 
marked them as being &#8220;out of place.&#8221; This includes 
people loitering outside of shops, or homeless people panhandling. 
Not surprisingly, this group includes individuals observed 
to be expressing their opposition to the CCTV cameras.</p>
<h4> 
Activists</h4>
<p>Experience has shown that CCTV systems may be used to spy 
on activist groups engaged in legal forms of dissent or 
discussion. For example, the City College of New York was 
embarrassed several years ago by student activists who found, 
much to their dismay, that the administration had installed 
surveillance cameras in their meeting areas. This trend 
shows no signs of abating: one of the more popular demonstrations 
of CCTV capabilities that law enforcement officials and 
manufacturers like to cite is the ability to read the text 
of fliers that activists post on public lampposts.</p>
<h4> 
Everyone else</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it&#8212;we all do things that are perfectly 
legal, but that we still may not want to share with the 
rest of the world. Kissing your lover on the street, interviewing 
for a new job without your current employer&#8217;s knowledge, 
visiting a psychiatrist&#8212;these are everyday activities 
that constitute our personal, private lives. While there 
is nothing wrong with any of them, there are perfectly good 
reasons why we may choose to keep them secret from coworkers, 
neighbors, or anyone else.</p>
<h3> 
But what&#8217;s the harm?</h3>
<p>Clearly, video surveillance of public space represents an 
invasion of personal privacy. But so what? Having one&#8217;s 
picture taken from time to time seems a small price to pay 
for the security benefits such surveillance offers. It&#8217;s 
not like anyone ever sees the tapes, and let&#8217;s be 
honest&#8212;being singled out for scrutiny by remote operators 
without your even knowing about it is not at all the same 
as being pulled over, intimidated and harassed by a live 
cop.</p>
<p> 
Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that simple. The fact is, 
there is very little oversight of video surveillance systems, 
and the question of who owns the tapes&#8212;and who has 
the right to see them&#8212;is still largely undecided.</p>
<p> Many of the cameras monitoring public space are privately 
owned. Banks, office buildings, and department stores all 
routinely engage in continuous video monitoring of their 
facilities and of any adjacent public space. The recordings 
they make are privately owned, and may be stored, broadcast, 
or sold to other companies without permission, disclosure, 
or payment to the people involved.</p>
<p> 
Similarly, video footage that is captured by public police 
departments may be considered part of the &#8220;public 
record,&#8221; and as such are available for the asking 
to individuals, companies, and government agencies. At present, 
there is precious little to prevent television programs 
like &#8220;Cops&#8221; and &#8220;America&#8217;s Funniest 
Home Movies&#8221; from broadcasting surveillance video 
without ever securing permission from their subjects.</p>
<p> 
Sound far-fetched? Already in the UK&#8212;the country that 
so far has made the most extensive use of CCTV systems (although 
the Canada and US are catching up)&#8212;there have been 
such cases. In the 1990&#8217;s, Barrie Goulding released 
&#8220;Caught in the Act,&#8221; a video compilation of 
&#8220;juicy bits&#8221; from street video surveillance 
systems. Featuring intimate contacts&#8212;including one 
scene of a couple having sex in an elevator&#8212;this video 
sensationalized footage of ordinary people engaged in (mostly) 
legal but nonetheless private acts.</p>
<p> 
Similarly, there has been a proliferation of &#8220;spy 
cam&#8221; websites featuring clandestine footage of women 
in toilets, dressing rooms, and a variety of other locations. 
A lack of legislative oversight allows these sites to operate 
legally, but even if new laws are passed, the nature of 
the internet makes prosecutions highly unlikely.</p>
<p> 
As video surveillance systems evolve and become more sophisticated, 
the opportunities for abuse are compounded. Sophisticated 
video systems can identify the faces of individuals (matching 
video images to databases of known faces&#8212;for example, 
the repository of driver&#8217;s license photos maintained 
by the Department of Motor Vehicles), the objects they carry 
(including, for example, reading the text on personal documents), 
and their activities. These systems enable the creation 
of databases that detail who you are, where you&#8217;ve 
been, when you were there, and what you were doing&#8230; 
databases that are conceivably available to a host of people 
with whom you&#8217;d rather not share such information, 
including employers, ex-lovers, and television producers.</p>
<p> 
Beyond these concerns, there is the question of the societal 
impact of our increasing reliance on surveillance, and our 
growing willingness to put ourselves under the microscope 
of law enforcement and commercial interests. Once a cold-war 
caricature of Soviet-style communist regimes, the notion 
of the &#8220;surveillance society&#8221; is now employed 
unironically to describe modern urban life in such supposed 
bastions of personal liberty and freedom as the United States, 
United Kingdom, and Canada.</p>
<p> 
While the nature of such a society has long been theorized 
by philosophers, critics, and sociologists (Jeremy Bentham, 
anyone?), the psychological and social effects of living 
under constant surveillance are not yet well understood. 
However, the impact of CCTV systems on crime is beginning 
to become clear.</p>
<h3>Video Surveillance and Crime</h3>
<p>Touted as a high-tech solution to social problems of crime 
and disorder by manufacturers selling expensive video surveillance 
systems to local governments and police departments, CCTV 
has gained much popularity in recent years. These manufactures 
claim that CCTV&#8212;which often costs upwards of $400,000 
to install in a limited area&#8212;will dramatically decrease 
criminal activity, and provide a measure of security heretofore 
unknown to the general public. Yet these CCTV systems are 
often purchased at the expense of other, less oppressive, 
less expensive, already proven law-enforecement methods 
such as community policing, and the statistics do not bear 
out their claims.</p>
<p> 
CCTV is often promoted with thinly veiled references to 
the threat of terrorism: hence their widespread use in the 
UK, which has long lived with bomb threats and other violent 
actions. Following the September 11 attacks, video surveillance 
manufacturers have increased their efforts to court the 
American public&#8212;with some success, as evidenced by 
recent gains in these companies&#8217; share prices.</p>
<p> 
Attempting to capitalize on an international tragedy to 
sell products in this manner is tastelessly opportunistic 
at best&#8212;but given the track record of CCTV systems 
to date, it&#8217;s downright cynical. According to studies 
of the effectiveness of video surveillance in use throughout 
the UK, there is no conclusive evidence that the presence 
of CCTV has any impact whatsoever on local crime rates. 
While there have been examples of reduced criminality in 
areas where CCTV has been installed, these reductions can 
just as easily be explained by other factors, including 
general decreases in crime throughout the UK. Indeed, in 
several areas where CCTV was installed, crime rates actually 
increased.</p>
<p> 
Given the widespread use of these systems, it is surprising 
how infrequently they lead to arrests. According to one 
report, a 22-month long surveillance of New York&#8217;s 
Times Square led to only 10 arrests, and the cameras involved 
have since been removed. Furthermore, the types of crime 
against which CCTV is most effective are small fry compared 
to the terrorism and kidnappings its advocates&#8217; claim 
it stops. A study of CCTV use in the UK found that the majority 
of arrests in which video surveillance played a significant 
role were made to stop fistfights. Not only that, but these 
were relatively infrequent already; and this hardly seems 
to justify the exorbitant costs and loss of privacy associated 
with these systems.</p>
<p> 
Even more disturbing, if not at all surprising, was the 
study&#8217;s finding that incidents of police brutality 
and harassment captured by CCTV surveillance were routinely 
ignored. The tapes of these events also had a tendency to 
be &#8220;lost&#8221; by operators.</p>
<p> 
The effect of video surveillance on criminal psychology 
is not well understood. One Los Angeles study found that 
cameras in a retail store were perceived by criminals as 
a challenge, and thus encouraged additional shoplifting.</p>
<p> 
At best, CCTV seems not to reduce crime, but merely to divert 
it to other areas. According to one Boston police official, 
&#8220;criminals get used to the cameras and tend to move 
out of sight.&#8221;</p>
<h3> 
Now More Than Ever</h3>
<p>Given heightened awareness of public safety and increased 
demand for greater security in the face of growing threats 
of terrorist violence, projects that undermine systems for 
social control may seem to some to be in poor taste. But 
it is our position that such times call all the more strongly 
for precisely these kinds of projects. There is a vital 
need for independent voices that cry out against the cynical 
exploitation of legitimate human fear and suffering for 
political power and monetary gain.</p>
