<h1>Adultery  (and other half revolutions)</h1>
<h5>A spectre is haunting the Western world: <br />
the spectre 
of Adultery.</h5>
<p> If the two-party relationship system is the pinnacle achievement of 
a hundred thousand years of human loving, why is adultery so common that 
it's practically counted on as material for bourgeois drawing room humor 
. . . and employment for a whole army of marriage counselors? If all any 
of us truly desire is our &quot;one true love," why can't we keep our 
hands off everyone else? </p>
<p> If you really want to know, you should cut straight to the source and 
ask the adulterer himself. Or maybe you don't have to go that far&#151;maybe 
you've had adulterous affairs or inclinations of your own, as the statistics 
suggest. </p>
<h3>"Good Marriages Take Work"</h3>
<p>Growing up in an environment dominated by capitalist economics teaches 
certain psychological lessons that are hard to unlearn: <i>Anything of 
value is only available in limited supplies. Stake your claim now, before 
you're left all alone with nothing</i>. We learn to measure commitment 
and affection in terms of how much others are willing to sacrifice for 
us, unable to imagine that love and pleasure could be things that multiply 
when shared. In a healthy relationship, conversely, friends or lovers 
enable each other to be able to do and live and feel <i>more</i>. If you 
feel, in your gut if not your head, that monogamy means giving something 
up (your "freedom," as they say), then the patterns of exploitation have 
penetrated even into your romantic life. Such cost-benefit calculations 
just don't compute. </p>
<p>We all know that Good Marriages Take Work. There it is again, <i>work:</i> 
the cornerstone of our alienation culture. Wage labor, relationship labor-are 
you ever not on the clock? Do you accept stifling limitations in return 
for affection and reassurance, the same way you trade time for money at 
your job? When you have to <i>work</i> at monogamy, you are back in the 
system of exchange: your intimacy economy is governed, just like the capitalist 
economy, by scarcity, threat, and programmed prohibitions, and protected 
ideologically by assurances that there are no viable alternatives. . . 
again, just like the capitalist economy. When relationships become work, 
when desire is organized contractually, with accounts kept and fidelity 
extracted like labor from employees, with marriage a domestic factory 
policed by means of rigid shop-floor discipline designed to keep the wives 
and husbands of the world chained to the machinery of responsible reproduction-then 
it should be no surprise that some individuals cannot help but revolt. 
</p>
<p>Adultery, in stark contrast to the Good Marriage, comes naturally, arriving 
without even being invited. Suddenly you feel transformed: awakened from 
the graveyard of once-vital passion that has been your relationship, to 
feel that excitement again. You shouldn't be feeling any of this, damn 
it, and yet it's the first time you've been carried away by pure, unforced 
happiness in who knows how long-and oh, the sweet optimism of something 
new, something that isn't yet fucking predictable. . . it's as if surprise, 
risk, gratification, fulfillment were again genuinely imaginable possibilities. 
Who, if they could feel what you're feeling right now, could possibly 
demand you resist? </p>
<h3>Stolen Moments. . .</h3>
<p>The adulterer gets a crash course in just how occupied the space and 
time he lives in is. It immediately becomes clear just how little free 
time he has, time when he is not <i>under observation</i>&#151;it turns 
out that the workday does not end when he leaves the workplace, but extends 
in both directions before and after it, consuming practically his whole 
life. The domination of his space, too, is revealed: how many places are 
there for him to spend time with his new lover, places he need not rent 
with money, respectable explanations, and the image of social responsibility? 
In what few moments of his life is he not held to guidelines imposed by 
outside forces, guidelines which plainly have nothing to do any longer 
with his emotional and physical needs? </p>
<p>The adulterer becomes a virtuoso of petty theft, stealing the moments 
of his life one by one from their "rightful owners": his spouse, his employer, 
family and social obligations. Just like the vandal, he resists the ownership 
of his world in the only way he knows how-by tiny and largely symbolic 
acts of daily sedition, out of which he carefully constructs an infinitely 
fragile alternate universe. There he hides, in spirit when he cannot in 
body, hoping not to be found out and called to account for what he has 
become: a traitor to the entire civilization that raised him. </p>
<h3>&#8220;Honesty is the Best Policy&#8221;</h3>
<p>Society, personified by his unfortunate spouse, demands that the adulterer 
be honest and frank about all things, when it will only punish him for 
this. It attempts to secure his compliance through routine interrogations 
("who was that on the phone, dear?"), surveillance ("do you think I didn't 
notice how much time you spent talking to her?"), search and seizure ("and 
just what the hell am I supposed to think this is?"), and more serious 
intimidation tactics: the threat of total expulsion from the only home 
and community he is likely to know. The adulterer who would like to be 
able to tell the truth is forced to use the Misery Quotient to compute 
whether he can permit himself to: <i>divide your current unhappiness by 
the harmful consequences of contesting it, multiply by your fear of the 
unknown, and then think twice about whether you really need to act after 
all</i>. This is the same formula used by exploited migrant workers and 
children locked in private school hells, by battered wives and sexually 
harassed secretaries. </p>
<p>What our society is missing here is the wisdom to know that telling the 
truth is not just the responsibility of the teller. If you really want 
to know the truth, you must make it easy for people to tell it to you: 
you must be genuinely supportive and ready for whatever it may be, not 
just make self-righteous demands or play good cop/bad cop ("just tell 
me, I promise I'll understand. . . you did WHAT?!"). That can only lead 
to evasive action, or at best to the subject of your cross-examination 
finding ways to lie to himself as well as you. Neither our society nor, 
consequently, its cuckolds and cuckoldesses, are ready for the revelation 
of truth that the adulterer has to offer; it is only safe in the sheltering 
ears of his illicit lover. </p>
<h3>"People Will Get Hurt"</h3>
<p>Inevitably, despite the best intentions and most secretive schemes of 
the adulterer, people get hurt. More to the point: people already <i>were</i> 
hurting, only invisibly, in the enforced happily-ever-after of domestic 
silence, or else such drastic measures would not have been necessary in 
the first place to bring dead hearts to life. Would it be better that 
the routines and illusions of the marriage remain undisturbed, forever, 
so that everyone's ennui could proceed on course to the embittered end? 
Could it be preferable for the unsuspecting partner to go on measuring 
her value as a lover and spouse according to the standard of a fidelity 
that boils down to self-denial, a standard which has already been violated 
in spirit of not in letter? Of course, instead of cheating you could always 
have gone to counseling, been "honest" with your spouse instead of yourself 
and turned away from the new landscapes you saw about to be born in the 
eyes of your potential lover, trying instead to achieve a passable imitation-substitute 
with your officially sanctioned partner-or resorted to medicating yourself 
into numb submission with television or Prozac, if that failed. . . </p>
<p> To cut to the heart of the matter: is it ever really wrong simply to 
desire not to be emotionally dead? What vast measures of self-confidence 
and entitlement would it take the modern married man or woman to risk 
feeling alive, unarmed with the twin weapons of self-justification and 
self-abasement, the excuses and apologies and self-recriminations? The 
adulterer discovers that he is trapped in the life he had adopted under 
the encouragement and threats of the established romantic standard, and, 
despite his best attempts to restrain himself, has begun to plot an escape. 
Were he to reflect lucidly on his situation, his secret self might rebel 
and begin to ask the important questions: What kind of life does he really 
aspire to live? How much freedom and fulfillment does he <i>deserve</i> 
to feel? How has it come to be that he hurts others just by reaching for 
what he needs for himself? </p>
<p>The fact is, people always get hurt whenever someone contests the long- 
entrenched order, even "innocent" people, and sometimes not the same innocent 
ones who were suffering at the hands of the old regime. That's why anything 
less than complete prostration to the status quo is considered bad ethics. 
But once the itch to mutiny has struck, the alternative to it becomes 
unthinkable (consider how much thinking those who opt for it do). . . 
so the adulterer takes it upon himself, often unwillingly but without 
being able to resist, to do things that hurt others, but no more than 
he absolutely has to. If he were prepared to embrace and proudly proclaim 
his outlawed desires (rather than ultimately rejecting them in a fit of 
apologetic revisionism: "I didn't know what I was doing!"), and take responsibility 
for the further pain that would cause, he would finally stand in a position 
from which he could <i>step out</i> of the circle of hurt that is the 
scarcity economy of love. But he lacks the courage and analysis for this 
final act: that is why he is still a mere adulterer, one who makes half 
a revolution-and the worst half, at that. </p>
<h3>"What About the Children?"</h3>
<p>"What about the children?" demand the shocked sentries of the bourgeoisie 
when they hear about yet another marriage endangered by an affair, terrified 
that their own strayings might come out next. Well, what about them? Do 
you think you can protect the next generation from the tragic tension 
between the complexity of desire and the simplicity of social prohibitions 
just by knuckling under yourself? If you smother your own aspirations 
for happiness, displacing them instead onto your expectations of future 
generations, you will end by smothering your children as well as yourself. 
Your children would be better off growing up in a world where people dare 
to be honest about what they want, whatever the consequences. Would you 
prefer that they learn to beat their own longings into flattened reminders 
of shame and remorse, as you do? </p>
<p>And it's worth pointing out that nuclear-family monogamy, which these 
self-appointed judges would protect from the assault implied by adultery, 
is the very thing that replaced the broader, more fluid, extended family 
structures of the past. By all accounts, children were better cared for 
in those environments, and their parents had more freedom as well. Could 
it be that adultery is a blind, desperate lunge for the extended community 
that we once had, from the cage of the contractual relationship-or at 
least could act as a stepping stone to a new form of it? </p>
<h3>Adultery is Marriage's Loyal Opposition.</h3>
<p>Ultimately, adultery is only possible because the questions it asks are 
left unanswered. Just like the shoplifter, the rioter, and the suicide, 
the adulterer makes only half a revolution: he violates the decrees of 
authoritarian convention and law, but in such a way that they remain in 
place, still dictating his actions-be those actions obedient or reactive. 
He would do better to expose what he is and wants to the whole world without 
guilt or remorse, and demand that it find a place for him and his desires, 
whatever they might be&#151;then his own struggle could be the starting 
point for a revolution in human relationships from which everyone might 
benefit, not just a flash of isolated passion and insurgency to be stomped 
out before it even becomes aware of itself. </p>
<p>Let us shelter and defend him from the shaming of this society whenever 
he does step forward, so that he may do so-for he acts, as we do, out 
of a passion burning unquenchably for a new world. </p>
<p> <i>"Hell yes I cheated!"</i> </p>
