<h1>The Domestication of Animals . . .<br>
. . . and of Man</h1>
<h5>a crimethInc. special report</h5> 
<p> Throughout the history of Western civilization the relationship of human 
beings to other animals has never been particularly "civil." What was 
once an uneasy coexistence swiftly became a relationship of domination 
and exploitation as humankind became more organized and technologically 
developed. In recent years, animal rights activists have brought international 
attention to the treatment and living conditions of animals in factory 
farms, zoos, circuses, and laboratories, but a serious discussion has 
yet to begin about the lives of the animals that exist in an environment 
that strikes much closer to home--the lives of domesticated animals, of 
our own household pets. A consideration of the lives our pets must lead 
reveals that they too are exploited in their relationship with human beings; 
but more than that, it also reveals something to us about ourselves. </p>
<p> Certainly there are plenty of happy, well-adjusted domesticated animals 
who manage to lead lives that are, for them, exciting and fulfilling. 
Still, history shows us that human beings in the worst of conditions, 
even during such periods of suffering and abomination as the Holocaust, 
have often managed to enjoy life, to fall in love and forge friendships, 
to find meaning in their day to day existence; for human beings are durable 
and resilient, and like all animals will adapt as well as they can to 
survive and thrive in any situation. So the fact that many animals--or 
humans, for that matter--are happy in our homes is by no means adequate 
reason to set aside a consideration of the merits of domesticated life. 
</p>
<p> Let us consider the usual contents of the lives of today's domesticated 
animals. Life begins, for most of them, in what we would refer to in human 
terms as a "broken home." Young dogs and cats are routinely taken from 
the company of their mothers and siblings at an extremely early age and 
thrust into an alien environment, whether it be a crowded, chaotic pet 
shop or the home of their new owner. Many of them are mistreated and abused 
(it is not at all uncommon for a dog, housecat, or parrot to have a phobia 
of human males, for many of them are abused by men in their youth), and 
many more are orphaned. More often than not, when domesticated animals 
reproduce it is looked upon as an unplanned inconvenience by their human 
owners, and the unwanted offspring are treated accordingly. Consider how 
difficult it is for young men and women who grow up in "broken homes," 
or in the adoption agency/youth reform program circuit, to become happy 
and self-confident, and it will become clear how difficult growing up 
must be for today's domesticated animals. </p>
<p> But a difficult childhood is the only the beginning of a difficult and 
unnatural life for today's typical housecat, gerbil, or parrot. For not 
only are the environments (i.e. cages, little glass boxes, six-room apartments 
and houses with climate control, and--at best--suburban back yards with 
the lawns mowed and bushes trimmed) which they must inhabit drastically 
different from those for which nature prepared them, but their role in 
the lives of the human beings who control their fate is itself unnatural. 
Most human beings who keep animals regard them as if they were, in some 
senses, toys rather than real animals. That seems like an unfair charge, 
but consider the usual relationship of these humans and animals, and the 
assumptions upon which the human owners keep these animals. Certainly 
these owners try to provide for the animals' needs, and often offer affection, 
but the fundamental role these animals play in the homes and lives of 
these people is the role of entertainment (and, often, of surrogate family/friends 
as well). That is, the animals are kept by the human beings in the expectation 
that they will bring some sort of fun, and perhaps love, in their owners' 
lives. Their role is not to be animals, that is, to hunt mice, to fly 
south for the winter, to chase down elk, to sharpen their claws where 
they please, to mark their territory with urine and court members of the 
opposite sex. Rather, they are expected to be modern court jesters or 
courtesans in the Western household. </p>
<p> The ramifications of this relationship between animals and humans are 
many, but we can see that this arrangement is not exactly in the best 
interest of the animals involved when we consider the "adjustments" human 
beings customarily make to their pets to make these pets fulfill their 
domestic roles more effectively. Housecats are the most obvious example: 
their owners routinely declaw and sterilize them so they will better fulfill 
their role as polite toys, rather than real animals, in the home. Having 
and using claws is a pretty basic part of being a cat; a cat without claws 
is like a human being without fingers: it may get used to the situation, 
and even figure out how to enjoy life despite the alteration, but something 
will be missing from its life forever. </p>
<p> Similarly, though some say that sterilization is humane and makes life 
simpler for these animals, is this a simplification any of us would willingly 
choose for ourselves? Sterilization affects more than just the sex lives 
of animals; it changes their hormonal balance, changing their very personalities. 
A sterilized cat will often gain weight, slow down, become less spirited. 
Sterilized cats and dogs are easier for their owners to deal with in a 
number of ways, but this must come at a cost to their enjoyment of life 
itself. A frustrated female cat in heat may not seem to be enjoying life 
very much, but if you take away a being's desires, what meaning is left 
for it to find in life? Left with its natural inclinations either surgically 
removed or frustrated by an environment much different than the one for 
which nature designed it, the sterilized cat will often become dull, grouchy, 
and fat--for eating the food its master provides is the only pleasure 
left to it. </p>
<p> Most of us can quickly call to mind an overweight, pathetic, neurotic 
dog or similarly maladjusted housepet that we have met at some time in 
our lives. These animals are the casualties of the exploitative relationship 
that exists today between humans and domesticated animals. Expected to 
be content as mere playthings, to eat standardized pet food that comes 
out of a box, and to live in quarters that are painfully cramped compared 
to their natural environments, it should come as no surprise that these 
animals are no longer as energetic or as passionate as wild animals. Once 
healthy and self-sufficient in their natural environment, these animals 
are now forced into humiliating dependence upon human beings who do not--cannot--permit 
them to live the lives that they would find fulfilling. </p>
<p> This is not to say that there is any truly viable alternative to domestication 
for these animals today. The "outside world" is no place for them to run 
wild or reproduce in; their natural habitats, for those animals who could 
still adapt back to them, have been changed beyond all recognition by 
pollution and other forces. The emerging new global environment, pockmarked 
by fields of asphalt, forests of steel, and cliffs of concrete, is only 
hospitable to pigeons and cockroaches. Compared to life in the "outside 
world," domesticated life is a lesser of two evils for housecats and parakeets 
alike. </p>
<p> And this is what is most tragic about this situation: there is no way 
out of the technological, over-organized world we have created; no way 
out for animals or humans. For we are really not much different from the 
animals we keep in cages and fishtanks in our homes: We too live in small, 
climate-controlled boxes, called apartments. We too buy standardized food 
to eat at McDonalds, food much different from the food our ancestors had 
evolved to eat. We too can find no outlet for our spontaneous, "wild" 
urges, castrated and declawed as we are by the necessities of living in 
cramped cities and suburbs under cramping legal and cultural restrictions. 
We too cannot wander far from our kennels, leashed as we are by 9-to-5 
jobs, by apartment leases, even by political boundaries. And if we did 
wander far, what would we find? Forests, jungles, wild plains, majestic 
canyons? These are swiftly disappearing as we work around the clock to 
wrap our world in a skin of concrete, to make sure that all the grass 
is watered by sprinklers and all the swamps are drained and surveyed to 
be turned into office space. And what we don't transform into bigger cages 
and fishtanks for ourselves, we will surely make useless with pollution, 
if we do not reconsider and redirect our actions on a massive scale. </p>
<p> Perhaps we can learn about ourselves from the example of our own pets. 
We might do well to learn from them that real happiness does not follow 
from merely providing for food, physical health, and safety, but from 
much more complicated elements of life. The solution to the problem of 
the emotional poverty of domesticated life for animals, and for humans, 
is clearly not a simple one. We must begin by reevaluating what life should 
be for humans and animals alike, and what our society must be so that 
our lives can be meaningful and fulfilling. And we do not have too much 
time to waste; for already we have bred dogs that do not know how to survive 
without leashes, and soon there may not be any going back for us either.

and four-legged cousins; you have done it to yourselves. You have changed 
men into chairmen of boards, into office workers, into time-clock punchers. 
You have changed your women into housewives, truly fearful creatures. 
I was once invited to the house of one. 'Watch the ashes, don't smoke, 
you'll stain the curtains. Watch the goldfish bowl, don't lean your head 
against the wallpaper; your hair may be greasy. Don't spill liquor on 
that table: it has a delicate finish. You should have wiped your boots; 
the floor was just varnished. Don't don't don't' That is crazy. You live 
in prisons you have built for yourselves, calling them 'homes, offices, 
factories.'" </i> </p>
