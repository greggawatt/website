<h5>&ldquo;Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness&rdquo;</h5>
<h1>washing . . . and brainwashing</h1> 
<p> <i>"The remaining noticable characteristic of 'Che' is his filth. He 
hates to wash and will never do so. He is filthy, even by the rather low 
standard of cleanliness prevailing among the Castro forces in the Sierra 
Maestra. Once in a while, "Che" would take some of his men to a stream 
or pool, in order that they might wash. On those occasions "Che" would 
never wash either himself or his clothes, but would sit on the bank and 
watch the others. He is really outstandingly and spectacularly dirty." 
<strong>&#151;slanderous description of Che Guevara from the 1958 C.I.A. dossier </strong></i></p>
<p> Even in the most anti-establishment of underground circles, I'm amazed 
by how frequently I hear people complain about people they call "hippies" 
or "crusty punks." "These crusty punks came in here and smelled up the 
whole place," they'll say. What great transgression have these people 
committed to be so reviled? They have a different orientation to the question 
of "cleanliness" than the rest of us do. </p>
<p> Where do our ideas and values about so-called "cleanliness" come from, 
anyway? Western civilization has a long history of associating cleanliness 
with goodness and merit, best summed up by the old expression "cleanliness 
is next to Godliness." In ancient Greek plays, evil people and spirits&#151;the 
Furies, for example&#151;were often described as filthy. The Furies were dirty, 
aged, and female, exactly the opposite of how the playwright who described 
them saw himself; their filthiness, among other things, identified them 
as an outgroup&#151;as alien, animal, inhuman. Over time, cleanliness became 
a measure with which the "haves" separated themselves from the "have-nots." 
Those who possessed the wealth and power required to have the leisure 
to remain indoors, inactive, scorned the peasants and travelers whose 
lifestyles involved getting their hands and bodies dirty. Throughout our 
history, we can see that cleanliness has been used as a standard of worth 
by those with power to ascribe social status&#151;and thus, the "Godly," the 
self-proclaimed holy ones who stood above the rest of us in hierarchical 
society, proclaimed that their cleanliness, bought with the labor of the 
others who were forced to work for them, was a measure of their "Godliness" 
and superiority. To this day, we accept this traditional belief: that 
being "clean" according to social norms is desirable in itself. </p>
<p> It should be clear from the history of our ideas about "cleanliness" 
that anyone who is critical of mainstream values, any radical or punk 
rocker, should be extremely suspicious of the great value placed on being 
"clean" according to traditional standards. Besides, what exactly does 
"clean" mean? </p>
<p> These days, cleanliness is defined more by corporations selling "sanitation 
products" than by anyone else. This is important to keep in mind. Certainly, 
most of these products have an uncanny ability to cut through natural 
dirt and grime&#151;but does removing natural dirt and grime with synthetic 
chemicals necessarily constitute the only acceptable form of sanitation? 
I'm at least as frightened by these manufactured, artificial products 
as I am of a little dust, mud, or sweat, or (god forbid!) a stain from 
food or blood on my shirt. At least I know where the dirt/"filth" came 
from and what it's made of! </p>
<p> The idea that it is worthwhile to use chemicals (whether they be deodorant, 
detergent, or shampoo) to eradicate organic dirt has some frightening 
implications, too. First, it supports the old Christian superstition that 
the biological body is shameful and should be hidden&#151;that our bodies and 
our existence in the physical world as animals are intrinsically disgusting 
and sinful. This groundless idea has been used to keep us insecure and 
ashamed, and thus at the mercy of the priests and other authorities who 
tell us how to become "pure": once, by submitting to their holy denial 
of the self, and now, by spending plenty of our money on the various "sanitation" 
products they want to sell us. Also, as capitalism transforms the entire 
world from the organic (forests, swamps, deserts, rivers) to the inorganic 
(cities of concrete and steel, suburbs of asphalt and astroturf, wastelands 
that have been stripped of all natural resources, garbage dumps) the idea 
that there is something more worthwhile about synthetic chemicals than 
natural dirt implies that this transformation might actually be a good 
thing... and thus implicitly justifies their profit-motivated destruction 
of our planet, </p>
<p> In reality, these corporations are far less concerned with our actual 
health and cleanliness than they are with selling us their products, anyway. 
They use the high value we traditionally have placed on sanitation to 
sell us all sorts of products in the name of cleanliness... and who knows 
what the real, long-term health effects of these products are? They certainly 
don't care. If we were to become ill in the long run from using their 
special cleansers and hi-tech shampoos, they could just sell us another 
product&#151;medicine&#151;and keep the wheels of the capitalist economy turning. 
And the shame about our bodies (as producers of sweat and other natural 
fluids which we deem "dirty") that they capitalize on and encourage also 
aids them in selling us other products which depend upon our insecurity: 
diet products, exercise products, fashionable clothes, etc. When we accept 
their definition of "cleanliness" we are accepting their economic domination 
of our lives. </p>
<p> Even if they agree about the questionable nature of today's sanitation 
products, most people today would still argue that sanitation is still 
healthier than filth. To some extent this is true&#151;it probably is a good 
idea to wash your feet if you step in shit. But, aside from obvious cases 
like that, there are a thousand different standards of what is clean and 
what is dirty across the world; if you look at different societies and 
civilizations, you come across health practices that seem suicidal by 
our sanitation standards. And yet, these people survive as well as we 
do. People in Africa a few hundred years ago lived comfortably in a natural 
environment that destroyed many of the very prim and polished Western 
explorers that came to their continent. Human beings can adapt to a wide 
variety of environments and situations, and it seems that the question 
of what kinds of sanitation are healthy is at least as much a question 
of convention as of hard-set biological rules. Try violating a few of 
the "common sense" rules of Western sanitation some time, and you'll find 
that going a few weeks without a shower and eating out of garbage cans 
aren't really as dangerous or difficult as we were taught. </p>
<p> Perhaps the most important question when it comes to the unusual value 
we place on traditional "cleanliness" is what we lose by doing this. Once, 
before we covered up our natural scents with chemicals, we each had a 
unique smell. These scents attracted us to each other and bound us emotionally 
to each other through memory and association. Now, if you have positive 
associations with the scent of the man you love, it is probably his cologne 
(identical to the cologne of thousands of other men) that you enjoy, not 
his own personal scent. And the natural pheromones with which we once 
communicated with each other, which played an important role in our sexuality, 
are now completely smothered by standardized chemical products. We no 
longer know what it is like to be pure, natural human beings, to smell 
like real human beings. Who knows how much we may have lost because of 
this? Those who find me disgusting for enjoying the scent and taste of 
my lover when she hasn't showered or rubbed synthetics all over herself, 
when she smells like a real human being, are probably the same ones who 
shudder at the idea of digging a vegetable out of the ground and eating 
it rather than eating the plastic-wrapped, man-made fast food that we 
have all been brought up on. We have become so accustomed to our domesticated, 
engineered existence that we no longer know what we might even be missing. 
</p>
<p> So try to be a little more open minded when it comes to the "crusties." 
Perhaps they just smell bad to you because you've never gotten a chance 
to discover what a real human being smells like. Perhaps there might be 
something worthwhile about being "unwashed" in the conventional sense 
that you haven't noticed before. The moral of this story is the moral 
of all anarchist stories: accept only the rules and values which make 
sense to you and really are in your best interest. Figure out what's right 
for you and don't let anybody tell you different&#151;but also, make an effort 
to understand where others are coming from, and evaluate their actions 
by your own standards, not according to some standardized norm. </p>

<h3>Eight Reasons Why Capitalists Want to Sell You Deodorant.</h3>
<p> 1. Body smells are erotic and sexual. Capitalists don't like that because 
they are impotent and opposed to all manifestations of sensuality and 
sexuality. Sexually awakened people are potentially dangerous to capitalists 
and their rigid, asexual system. </p>
<p> 2. Body smells remind us that we are animals. Capitalists don't want 
us to be reminded of that. Animals are dirty. They eat things off the 
ground, not out of plastic wrappers. They are openly sexual. They don't 
wear suits or ties, and they don't get their hair done. They don't show 
up to work on time. </p>
<p> 3. Body smells are unique. Everyone has her own body smell. Capitalists 
don't like individuality. There are millions of body smells but only a 
few deodorant smells. Capitalists like that. </p>
<p> 4. Some deodorants are harmful. Capitalists like that because they are 
always looking for new illnesses to cure. Capitalists love to invent new 
medicines. Medicines make money for them and win them prizes; they also 
cause new illnesses so capitalists can invent even more new medicines. 
</p>
<p> 5. Deodorants cost you money. Capitalists are especially pleased about 
that. </p>
<p> 6. Deodorants hide the damage that capitalist products cause your body. 
Eating meat and other chemical-filled foods sold by capitalists makes 
you smell bad. Wearing pantyhose makes you smell bad. Capitalists don't 
want you to stop wearing pantyhose or eating meat. </p>
<p> 7. Deodorant-users are insecure. Capitalists like insecure people. Insecure 
people don't start trouble. Insecure people also buy room fresheners, 
hair conditioners, makeup, and magazines with articles about dieting. 
</p>
<p> 8. Deodorants are unnecessary. Capitalists are very proud of that and 
they win marketing awards for it. </p>
