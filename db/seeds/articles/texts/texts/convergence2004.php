in Des Moines</h1>

<p>
We 
spent months organizing and fundraising. Everything we did 
leading up to the gathering seemed to fall right into place. 
A week before the convergence was to start, two kids showed 
up early to help out and explore the city. They turned out 
to be amazing individuals with whom I hope to work again 
soon. We spent the following week gathering food items and 
other miscellaneous necessaries. Groups and individuals 
started to show up as early as Wednesday. Everyone helped 
out around the house where we were staying, which I found 
quite refreshing. By night, we traded tales of our adventures 
traveling to Des Moines, and plotted new ones for the days 
that would follow. This was especially interesting because 
unlike similar convergences, people were showing up with 
completely different agendas. Some were here simply to engage 
in conversation, others to form affinity groups for the 
protests at the upcoming Republican National Convention, 
a few simply for a free ride to NYC, but most because they 
wanted change in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Friday 
night came quickly, and as the convergence officially began, 
things were off to a good start. Everyone traveled out to 
the camp site, and we had already started planning for the 
next few days. I was unable to attend the first few hours, 
due to circumstances out of my control, but Friday night 
seemed to go well; we prepared for the massive Food Not 
Bombs we had planned for the next day, at which skill shares 
and workshops would ensue in the middle of downtown Des 
Moines.</p>
<p>Saturday 
began with Food Not Bombs at noon. It went well, as we fed 
more homeless people that day than any other in recent memory. 
Afterwards, people split up into small groups to dumpster 
and gather food for the night. I got out to the campsite 
at around 10:00 pm, and was informed that the police had 
arrested at least one person in Des Moines on account of 
an allegedly broken Radio Shack window and supposed possession 
of a slingshot. Because the individual was a minor, he was 
put in Juvenile Hall, which made it very difficult for us 
to obtain information on his situation. This development 
was unfortunate news, because it offered a set up for constant 
police and FBI harassment and intimidation for the duration 
of the convergence.</p>
<p>We 
didn&#8217;t let this affect our plans, however. We continued 
our efforts, doing everything we could to get our friend 
out of jail and to maintain morale and motivation in our 
numbers. We held a security culture workshop later that 
night, and everyone agreed to be very cautious when doing 
anything that would give the authorities any more opportunity 
than they already had to disrupt our activities. Of course, 
our being anarchists was itself sufficient to bring upon 
us all the scrutiny and repression they could muster. The 
intimidation tactics the authorities used the next few days 
were straight of the textbook: they threatened us with evictions, 
conspiracy charges, arrests, and so on. However, a few individuals 
didn&#8217;t take the situation seriously, and were arrested 
the following day, Monday, for stealing books at a Barnes 
&amp; Noble. It seemed at this point that they were just 
picking us off one by one, and were clearly hoping to prevent 
all of us from going to the Republican National Convention. 
Materials that were to be used in workshops and skillshares 
mysteriously disappeared from our campsite, including lamp 
oil that was to be used for a fire-breathing skillshare 
and PVC pipe that was to be used in a home-made didgeridoo 
workshop. The pigs then issued a statement saying they had 
&#8220;evidence&#8221; that we were planning to make bombs 
and carry out attacks at the RNC. At that point, an article 
for which a friend of mine had been interviewed a week earlier 
came out in the press, preparing the public for such ridiculous 
accusations and calling them &#8220;typical police tactics 
that have been used to demonize anarchists and activists 
alike for well over 100 years.&#8221; This proved to be 
helpful, as we gained public support from many local activist 
groups.</p>
<p>Tuesday 
night, we held a screening of the film The Fourth World 
War at a local venue, and there was a surprising turnout, 
raising over $200.</p>
<p>Wednesday 
some people who had affinity groups waiting for them in 
New York City left early for the demonstrations. That night, 
another member of our group was arrested on &#8220;5th degree 
theft charges,&#8221; on account of an American flag supposedly 
stolen from a local resident near the campsite&#8212;although 
the police would never release the person&#8217;s name or 
give any evidence that the person even existed. My friend, 
the arrestee, just so happened to have a piece of an American 
Flag around his injured ankle.</p>
<p>Thursday, 
everyone left safely as planned for the Republican National 
Convention, in a group about ten people strong. I stayed 
in town an extra day waiting for my friend to be released 
from jail, and on Friday we were on our thirty-hour greyhound 
bus ride to New York.</p>
<p> Although some of the activities we had planned were effectively 
disrupted, I still believe that this was a good experience 
for everyone. The most important thing to remember, in my 
opinion, is that as we want to be taken seriously, we have 
to expect to be taken seriously by the authorities. This 
harassment came as no surprise to me, and shouldn&#8217;t 
have to anyone else either. We were obviously doing something 
effective, and frightened them enough to take the actions 
they did. We just need to learn to be strong, and do as 
much as we can to prepare, and fight back against anything 
they dish out.</p>
