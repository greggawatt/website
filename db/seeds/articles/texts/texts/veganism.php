<h1>Veganism.</h1>
<p> What I find sorely lacking in most of the discussions of veganism I 
encounter in hardcore is any sense of economic context. Usually, the question 
of animal oppression is approached only in terms of compassion and prejudice: 
animals are exploited and destroyed, bands like Earth Crisis would have 
us believe, simply because we see them as subhuman and are willing to 
abuse them in order to satisfy our greed. I suspect that the problem runs 
much deeper than mere cruelty and avarice. Under capitalism, it's not 
just animals that are exploited&#151;it's everyone and everything from farmlands 
and forests to farmhands and grocery clerks. The oppression of animals 
is just a little more obvious to us because it involves the murder of 
living things; but it's not just animals that have been enslaved and transformed 
by our society, it's everything, ourselves included. Without an understanding 
of how and why our social/economic system drives us to seek to dominate 
and exploit everything, we will not be able to alter the way animals are 
treated in any significant or long-lasting way. Capitalism forces us to 
evaluate our environment and each other according to market value. Under 
the capitalist system, every man is encouraged to ask the question of 
how useful the animals and people around him might be as economic resources 
in his competition with others. Everything becomes fair game for exploitationâ€”because 
if you don't exploit something in the rush to gain the upper hand in the 
free market's "exchange of goods and services," someone else will exploit 
it, and quite possibly use it to exploit you. Those who have realized 
this are not afraid to exploit animals or humans, to treat them as objects, 
because they believe that the alternative is to be treated as objects 
and exploited by others themselves. In this way, capitalism divides us 
against each other and spurs on our destruction of the environment. </p>
<p> When I walk through the aisles at the supermarket, looking at all the 
products for sale around me, perhaps I can tell which ones are manufactured 
from the exploitation of animals, but I can't tell which ones&#151;if any&#151;are 
manufactured without exploiting anyone or anything. That is one of the 
biggest drawbacks about our modern mass-production/distribution/consumption 
economy: by the time the product has reached you, it is virtually impossible 
to tell who made it, how it was made, what it was made from, or where 
it has been. Toilet paper, canned kidney beans, and athletic shoes all 
sit on the shelves next to each other, as if they appeared out of the 
air, and it would be a long hard struggle to track down any real, sound 
information about the origins of any of them. But there are some things 
I do know, though, even if I can't research the life story of each individual 
packet of ramen noodles: there are migrant workers in this country who 
are underpaid and mistreated, there are corporations (like Pepsi) known 
for supporting totalitarian governments that mercilessly destroy human 
life, there are shoe manufacturers (like Nike) that underpay and mistreat 
foreign workers, there are companies (like Exxon) whose policies result 
in permanent damage to the environment. So the idea that you can be sure 
that your dollars are not financing anything inhumane or destructive just 
by examining the ingrediants of a product and ascertaining that it includes 
no animal products strikes me as absurd. There are a thousand other kinds 
of oppression, just as outrageous as animal oppression, that keep the 
wheels of our economy turning, and there is no reason to be less concerned 
about any of them than about animal oppression. </p>
<p> It seems to me that the long term solution to this problem is not just 
to buy vegan food and animal-friendly products. If we want to change the 
conditions that have resulted in the widespread destruction and exploitation 
that characterize our world, we must work towards a complete overhauling 
of our economy&#151;we must somehow escape from the vicious cycle of capitalism. 
The only way to fight capitalism is to undermine its assumptions: that 
happiness is having things ("the one who dies with the most toys wins"), 
that there is no realistic way to work with each other rather than competing 
against each other, that any other economic system means some kind of 
slavery (like the former communist U.S.S.R.). If these assumptions are 
untrue, which isn't hard to imagine, then it should be possible for us 
to create a different kind of economy and a different kind of world. If 
people start to conceive of happiness as the freedom to do things rather 
than have things, if they decide that they enjoy being generous more than 
being selfish, if they can imagine that it might be possible to create 
a society in which we work together for the good of everybody rather than 
against each other and the environment for (what advertisements claim 
is) our own good, then capitalism will ultimately fall. </p>
<p> In the meantime, rather than practising veganism, I practise "freeganism." 
I know that as long as I participate in the mainstream economy, whether 
I am buying vegan or non-vegan products, I am supporting the corporations 
which represent world capitalism. So rather than just buying animal-friendly 
products, I try to purchase as few products as possible. I've written 
about this in earlier issues of Inside Front: it is possible, through 
thrifty living, creative "urban hunting and gathering," and projects like 
Food Not Bombs, to survive without contributing more than a minimal amount 
of money or labor to the mainstream economy. Anything I can get for free 
at the expense of the exploiting, oppressing capitalist system is a strike 
against that system, while purchasing vegan food from Taco Bell (which 
is owned by Pepsi Co.) is still putting money into the hands of an oppressive, 
exploiting corporation. I live off of whatever resources I can scrounge 
or steal from our society, trying to avoid animal products when I can, 
but concentrating above all on keeping my money and labor out of of their 
hands. A willingness to pump money into the mainstream economy, which 
is responsible for the oppression of animals and humans and the destruction 
of the environment, through consumer spending (on fashionable athletic 
clothes, for example), is not compatible with the professed goal of most 
people who follow a vegan diet, which is to end the exploitation of animals. 
That's why it strikes me as ridiculous that so many vegan activist bands 
like Earth Crisis are willing to perpetuate fashion consciousness in hardcore 
by selling so much merchandise&#151;and by speaking only about human cruelty 
rather than criticizing consumerism in general, they ignore the real causes 
of animal oppression. </p>
<p> There are some great things about veganism, by the way. First of all, 
if you can't bear to put anything into your body that was actually made 
from the corpse of another living being, veganism is a way to avoid that 
(although it DOES NOT magically confer the "innocence" of animal exploitation 
that hardline morons claim for themselves, as my discussion of capitalism 
and other forms of oppression should make clear). Also, it gives you a 
different relationship to the food you eat than most of us have: it makes 
you consider where it came from and what's in it, rather than just taking 
it for granted, and it also will probably make you a better cook! And 
finally, it brings up the issue for everybody. When you won't eat food 
unless you know what is in it, it forces the people around you to think 
for themselves about what is in the food and how it got there. In that 
way, veganism does more to change the world than writing lengthy political 
responses to letters ever could: it brings up important questions in everyday 
life and forces people think about questions that they wouldn't otherwise 
encounter. </p>
