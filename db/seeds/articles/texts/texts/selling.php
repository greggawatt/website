<h1>Selling Ourselves Out</h1>
<h5><i>(Why just "selling things" is <br />
inherently counter-revolutionary)</i></h5>
<p> Look at the hardcore community, from a distance&#151;what do you see? The 
most visible signs of our existence, besides bands playing in basements 
and rented out halls, are the 'zines and records we sell. And open up 
almost any one of those 'zines, and you see advertisements for other 'zines, 
other records, other products. In fact, aside from the advertisements, 
what are most of our 'zines about? The record reviews, the 'zine reviews, 
the top ten lists all deal with products to buy and sell. The photos of 
hardcore bands hopping around and shouting invariably feature kids dressed 
in certain styles (band shirts, tattoos, etc.), as if to indicate that 
these fashions, which are not too cheap, are an intrinsic part of being 
involved in hardcore. </p>
<p> And when you get more deeply involved in hardcore, you find that you 
really do spend quite a bit of time buying and selling products. You start 
going to more shows and buying the records and 'zines you hear about. 
You buy some band shirts and maybe purchase some clothes, piercings, or 
tattoos that are similar to the ones your friends in the hardcore community 
have. You start a 'zine of your own, and have to worry about how to buy 
the copies to make it, and&#151;how to sell it. You start a band, and worry 
about making demos and selling them, about buying equipment and being 
paid to play shows; you start a distribution, and worry about how to sell 
all the things you order; you start a record label, and you worry about 
selling records, buying advertising, selling more records, more and more 
buying and selling. That seems to be one of the main themes of hardcore 
today, if not the main theme: economics. One of the main things that identifies 
a kid who is getting involved in hardcore is the records and 'zines he 
buys; and the people who are more deeply involved usually spend even more 
time thinking about economics&#151;worrying about money, about promoting their 
products, about sales and profits, since most of the projects we undertake 
in hardcore right now seem to be business enterprises. That's the problem: 
most of the projects we undertake in the hardcore community right now 
seem to be business enterprises. </p>
<p> Of course we have to sell things to be able to make them and share them 
with each other at all, living as we do in a capitalist system where it's 
difficult get anything for free. But if this is the case, we still should 
be more aware of the effects of the ways we conduct business, and also 
strive for alternatives so that we will not be limited to only one form 
of interaction. And if we truly are interested in transforming our lives 
in fundamental ways, rather than just going through the motions of being 
another youth subculture, buying and selling products should play a much 
smaller role in our community than it does. It should be extremely clear 
from looking at the corporate exploitation of the hippy subculture, the 
(pop) punk subculture, and a thousand other youth subcultures that any 
community/subculture that focuses primarily on products and image is vulnerable 
to being taken over by corporate interests. We can't beat "the Man" by 
playing his own game. Besides, there are so many other kinds of interaction 
that are worth trying, that might be better for all of us. </p>
<h3>SELLING THINGS IS NOT "PROGRESS"</h3>
<p> First of all, and most importantly, we must remember that by itself 
selling things does not accomplish anything. Just because more kids bought 
hardcore records this year than ever before does not mean that the ideas 
on those hardcore records are going to affect more people in genuine ways. 
In fact, some methods of promotion and distribution that work to increase 
sales also work to distract attention (both the record label's attention 
and the buyers' attention) from the ideas that are addressed on the record, 
as we'll discuss below. </p>
<p> Buying and selling goods and services is the foundation of our economy 
here in the U.S.A. and Europe, and consequently, it often seems to be 
the central focus of our lives. We spend half of our waking hours and 
most of our energy at our careers, and almost all the careers available 
have to do with selling things or services, or promoting those sales, 
etc. And where has that gotten us? The companies that sell the most useless 
products, like Coca Cola, achieve the biggest sales, because they can 
afford to spend the most money on advertising and promoting their pointless 
product. A number of large corporations are destroying the environment 
(McDonalds, Exxon, etc.) and animals (the meat and dairy industry), financing 
oppression of human beings (Pepsi, etc.), promoting products that destroy 
people (the tobacco industry, etc.), and mistreating or underpaying their 
workers (Nike and almost every other corporation I can think of)&#151;all 
in the name of profit, because profit is the most important goal in this 
kind of economy. The corporations that will not sell things as ruthlessly 
as the others, that will not stomp over anything in their path to increase 
sales, die out, while the corporations that act with the least concern 
for the world in their quest for sales come to dominate the economy (and 
thus the world) when "selling things" is the main focus. The products 
that cater to the lowest common denominator (bad television shows, silly 
movies, etc.) achieve the widest sales in this system, and come to dominate 
our lives. Because our society treats "selling things" as an end rather 
than a means, we live in a world that is fucked up in a thousand different 
ways. </p>
<p> Do we really want to mirror mainstream society in our own community 
by concentrating on that same kind of economic interaction? It seems possible 
that that system might have the same effects in hardcore that it does 
in mainstream society, if we're not careful. That is to say&#151;the labels 
and other hardcore businesses that have the least scruples, that care 
the least about the value of their products and the effects of the ways 
they sell their products, might come to have the most power and influence 
in a scene where selling things is the main focus... because though other 
labels might care more about the way they go about business, they won't 
be able to compete with the marketing and business savvy of their ruthless, 
heartless competitors. And then, though some kids who have come to be 
concerned about issues like consumerism would choose to support the more 
independent/not-profit-motivated labels, the labels that were the most 
visible to the most people would be the ones who concentrated the most 
on pure sales alone and thought little about anything else. </p>
<p> In fact, if you look at hardcore right now, it's not hard to see that 
very thing happening. </p>
<h3>ADVERTISING</h3>
<p> When you sell things, it's necessary to let people know that that they 
are available from you, and so advertising has become a fundamental part 
of the way we do business today, both inside and outside of the hardcore 
community. This affects us in a couple of ways. First of all, "lowest 
common denominator" advertising, which de-emphasizes the important qualities 
of the product (assuming that it has important qualities to begin with) 
and can lead people to purchase things which are useless to them, usually 
is more effective than truly informative advertising; you can imagine 
what kinds of products and business practices this encourages. Second, 
in a more subtle way, advertising in the hardcore community can actually 
contribute to the feeling that just buying and selling things is accomplishing 
something. </p>
<p> I. Most of the big corporations that use advertising to sell their products 
don't give a fuck about their consumers. Sales and profit are their chief 
motivations, so they will advertise their products in any way that will 
sell them, whether it is in the best interest of the buyers to buy them 
or not. Advertising of this kind boils down to low-level mind control: 
companies pay advertising agents (psychologists!) to figure out which 
images and rhetoric will sell a product most effectively. That's why car 
commercials have beautiful (so-called beautiful) women in them; that's 
why toothpaste commercials have meaningless statistics in them; that's 
why advertisements for soda and jeans are filled with things that have 
nothing at all to do with soda or jeans. These images, which have fucking 
nothing to do with whether the product will be useful to an individual 
viewing the advertisement, nevertheless make it more likely that the individual 
will buy the product. If you give a fuck about people at all, you can 
see how this kind of advertising is&#151;dare I use this term?&#151;unethical. 
</p>
<p> And unfortunately, these ads really are the ones that sell products 
the most effectively&#151;even in the hardcore scene, it seems. Look in any 
hardcore magazine, and you see advertisements that have nothing to do 
with the products they are selling. Instead of using the space to tell 
you about the records that are for sale, what the music sounds like and 
what the themes are, these advertisements feature some catchy slogan and/or 
funny picture encouraging consumerism. A good example is a recent Trustkill 
advertisement featuring a little girl kissing a little boy and saying 
"My boyfriend bought me all the new releases on Trustkill!" That doesn't 
really tell you much about the records, but it uses silliness to stick 
in your head and maybe encourage you to buy Trustkill records&#151;I guess 
the idea is that if you buy Trustkill records, you will instantly win 
the heart of the girl next door... just like the idea implicit in the 
car commercials featuring beautiful women is that buying a car will make 
you attract women (the image suggests that a pretty woman "comes with 
the car"). I hate to pick on a friend, but another good example is the 
latest Edison advertisement, which proclaims "the Grace of Brutality" 
across a photograph of crying Vietnamese children who have just had their 
clothes burned off by American napalm&#151;that's fucking tasteless, using 
images of real human suffering inflicted by the last generation of American 
men just to sell the music made by their sons. It would make sense if 
any of the records being advertised actually addressed the issue of the 
Vietnam war, but they don't; instead they're just described as having 
"evil metallic riffing," etc. </p>
<p> This is not to say that anyone is completely innocent of using image 
at the expense of content in advertisements. Right now, you have to, to 
get anyone's attention. But if kids would pay more attention to what an 
advertisement says, rather than how cute or fancy it is, and advertisers 
would make an effort to print ad's that would honestly inform people about 
the records without just trying to sell them at any cost, we could get 
away from some of the more negative qualities of advertising. There's 
just something stomach-turning about opening a hardcore magazine that 
is supposed to talk about changing the world, doing something positive 
with our lives, etc. and seeing nothing but record companies shouting 
"BUY OUR STUFF!!" at the top of their lungs. If you give a fuck about 
us, use your ad to tell us why we might want to buy it, rather than just 
trying to manipulate us. </p>
<h4>II. But there's another issue to consider in our advertising 
as well.</h4>
<p> The way these corporate-style psychological advertisements work is by 
selling images. For example: a soap commercial features an attractive 
mother cleaning her sweet, well-behaved children's clothes, while her 
handsome husband relaxes in the background. This ad isn't so much selling 
soap as it is selling the image of the "perfect American family"&#151;that's 
why the soap itself isn't discussed at all. The silent suggestion is that 
if you buy the soap, it will bring with it the status of having a perfect 
family and a perfect household. This sounds sort of far-fetched, but it 
really works; otherwise the thousands and thousands of advertising agents 
across the U.S. and Europe would not use this technique over and over 
to get people to buy their products. Of course the truth is that when 
you buy the soap, you just get soap&#151;a perfect family life is not included 
with it after all. But the suggestion still works to keep you buying it. 
</p>
<p> A similar effect can take place in hardcore advertisements that, like 
the ones CrimethInc. sometimes makes, tout how "revolutionary" the products 
being sold are. These advertisements can sometimes work the way the soap 
advertisement I just described works: they can create the impression that 
by buying the record or 'zine, the revolution will come with it, when 
that is simply not the case. Worse than that, when they are used to advertise 
records revolutionary thinking and slogans become just another marketing 
tool to encourage kids to buy things rather than to actually cause change. 
"Smash the State," which used to mean "vigorously strive to overthrow 
the government and the oppressive power structures built into our modern 
society," now comes to mean "buy the new record by Chokehold!" Thus what 
was once a desire for real revolution is subverted into a motivation for 
consuming products and keeping the wheels of the present system turning. 
To sum up: Are you using your band to "sell" revolution, or are you using 
"revolution" to sell your band? </p>
<p> In regards to this problem, it's up to the buyer to remember that just 
buying a hardcore record or political pamphlet, etc. is not, by itself, 
going to accomplish anything. That's common sense, but advertising can 
sometimes obscure the issue. And it is up to the labels to resist the 
temptation to make advertisements that seem to suggest that buying their 
records will accomplish anything by itself. Labels should make sure that 
it is clear in their advertisements that they are only selling tools for 
revolution, not revolution itself. </p>
<h3>HOW BUYING THINGS AFFECTS THE BUYER</h3>
<p> Besides the pitfalls of advertising, there are other possible drawbacks 
to selling things in the hardcore community. One of the biggest of those 
is that the money to buy them has to come from somewhere. The more records, 
'zines, band shirts, etc. a hardcore kid buys, the more money he needs 
to buy them. And not everyone can live off of a distribution/label/tattoo 
parlor, you know. So the more records kids buy, the more money they have 
to earn&#151;the more they have to work for some employer to earn the money! 
Elsewhere in this issue and the last one, the unpleasant qualities of 
modern day employment are discussed. That's not something we want to encourage. 
</p>
<p> Because it's not even like kids are buying hardcore records instead 
of the usual products from objectionable corporations. In the hardcore 
community, we sell luxuries, not necessities. No matter how many records, 
'zines, band shirts, etc. you purchase, you still have to pay for food, 
for rent, for health care. So our countercultural businesses only contribute 
to the problem of people having to work jobs they don't like, by making 
it necessary that they earn more money to pay for our hardcore products 
as well as everything else. And no matter how independent and D.I.Y. our 
labels are, they still aren't actually fighting against big business, 
because those big businesses have a complete monopoly on the goods and 
services we need to survive. It doesn't matter much whether your CD has 
a bar code on it when your food, your rent, your every other need is supplied 
by the companies that use bar codes on CD's. </p>
<p> So selling things like records and 'zines, at least right now, helps 
to perpetuate the status quo in which everyone has to work at jobs they 
wish they could quit. This is not to say that it's not worth doing, if 
the value of the records and 'zines outweighs their negative effects on 
people's lives. But it's worth keeping in mind. It might be more worth 
doing to try to figure out a way to liberate ourselves permanently from 
the employment system, rather than spending our energy on selling luxuries 
like records while most of our lives must still revolve around wasted 
time and wasted potential... </p>
<h3>HOW SELLING THINGS AFFECTS THE SELLER</h3>
<p> When you have to concentrate on selling things, as anyone working within 
the confines of today's exchange economy must, it's easy to get caught 
up in it and forget about whatever other goals you started with. In order 
to function at all in spreading your releases, no matter how good your 
intentions are, you have to worry about being at least profitable to survive&#151;and 
thus, to some degree, you have to worry about making the things that you 
sell marketable. The ones who are willing to compromise more to make their 
products sell better usually do end up selling them more effectively, 
so the products that reach the most people are often the ones that are 
the most watered-down, the least genuine. </p>
<p> You must compete for sales with others who may have the same goals as 
you, which can create unnecessary animosity, and makes people work against 
each other (just to survive and keep functioning) rather than together, 
which might be more effective in accomplishing things. This competition 
makes you have to think about selling competitively, and it becomes easy 
to associate increased sales with making progress, when in truth the things 
you have to do to attain these sales increases may work against the goals 
you originally started with. </p>
<p> If you started out selling things to try to spread ideas of some kind, 
you find that you have much less time to think about the ideas, to talk 
about them with others, to work on nourishing their development. Instead, 
you have to always be working on practical concerns. There's no time for 
reading books, because you have to answer mailorders or buy advertisements. 
You spend more time arguing with distributors than you do brainstorming 
with others who might have valuable ideas to contribute. Pretty soon sales 
are all you think about, all you have time to think about, and it becomes 
hard to stay focused on your original goals, or even to really remember 
them, through the haze of practical business concerns. </p>
<p> And that is why there are so many businesses in the hardcore community 
that started out with good intentions and were completely transformed 
by the years of competition and worrying about sales. Now many of them 
care about nothing but making money, at any cost. Selling things can do 
that to you&#151;it can strip away all your ideals and dreams, until you can 
only focus on profit. And those who focus only on selling things for profit 
will never be able to change anything for the better in this world. </p>
<h3>OTHER CONCERNS</h3>
<p> Some people think that the problems that an exchange economy (an economy 
which revolves around buying and selling things) creates for human beings 
are insoluble inside of such a system. This analysis suggests that as 
long as people only have access to the goods and services that they can 
trade their own goods and services for, human beings will always be in 
danger of being forced to spend their lives doing things they don't enjoy 
or care about in order to have the resources they need to survive. The 
thinkers who consider this flaw to be intrinsic to the exchange economy 
suggest instead a "gift economy," where things are shared rather than 
exchanged. </p>
<p> This aspect of this discussion is really complicated, and cannot be 
treated in detail here. If you are interested in it, an in-depth consideration 
of the "exchange economy" versus the "gift economy" is scheduled to appear 
in the second issue of Harbinger, a free CrimethInc. propaganda tabloid, 
in December of this year. [If you want one, just write any of the CrimethInc. 
addresses and ask for one&#151;the most dependable one is still probably the 
Atlanta address] </p>
<h3>TO CONCLUDE: TWO SUGGESTIONS</h3>
<p> First of all, we should consider all the other things there are we can 
do together in hardcore besides just imitating the businessmen of mainstream 
society by selling each other things. Despite its silly name, Food Not 
Bombs, which I mention elsewhere in this issue, is a great example of 
a way people in the hardcore community can work together in ways that 
are positive and productive for everyone. If you want to be active and 
involved in hardcore, there are a million different things (more useful 
things?) you can do besides starting a label, or writing a 'zine, or working 
on something else you have to worry about selling. You could organize 
fliering/propaganda troops, political action groups, sports or exercise 
groups, book reading clubs, self-defense (anti-police) vigilante squads, 
try starting a squat, arrange a hostel space for traveling bands and punk 
rockers, write articles for other people's magazines, try new mediums 
of expression (artwork, etc.). Of course, in order to have time and resources 
to work on projects that you don't earn money from, you'll need a supportive 
community around you, but that topic is addressed elsewhere in this issue. 
Similarly, rather than just buying records, there are a million other 
things that a person who has only been involved in hardcore punk for a 
little while can do to participate. Corresponding with hardcore punk kids 
from far away is already common, and offers a lot of possibilities. Make 
mix tapes for each other. Come up with your own creative fashions, that 
you can wear cheaply or free, rather than paying for overpriced styles 
that have already been prefabricated for you. Break into abandoned buildings 
and go exploring, organize a walkout from your school or workplace, hitchhike 
around the world, sit up late at night trading stories and arguing about 
stupid Inside Front articles, go crazy. After you've broken out of traditional 
patterns of action and interaction, the sky's the limit. </p>
<p> And, second, we should certainly not give up on selling things like 
records and 'zines that cost money to make. Until some hardcore punk commando 
unit seizes a record pressing plant and starts making vinyl for free, 
we have to finance those records somehow. But we should always keep in 
mind the limitations of selling and advertising things&#151;that these activities 
by themselves won't accomplish anything. We can buy and sell things without 
betraying ourselves, if we stay focused on our real goals. But in order 
to do this, we must be aware of the ways that selling and advertising 
things can compromise the power and quality of the things being sold&#151;and 
even of the people being sold to. In this article I tried to describe 
some of those dangers, but each of us should think about the topic individually. 
</p>
<p> Last March, while my band was in the studio, I made some notes on the 
back of a lyric sheet for a "footnote" I'd like to put in every advertisement 
for CrimethInc. records: </p>
<p> Please do not buy this product because it looks attractive or because 
all your friends have one. For your sake, don't waste your money on it 
unless you know what it is you're purchasing and think that it really 
might be useful or meaningful to you. Please do not think that merely 
purchasing this product is going to do anything to change the world, or 
to improve your life or anyone else's. Right now, we can't effectively 
distribute these ideas and music without selling them, but just selling 
them is not our goal; it is only a means to an end. We try to sell these 
records in a way that does not compromise the power of their content&#151;we 
want to sell them like we would sell any other kind of weapon against 
the status quo, with the emphasis upon their usefulness in making people 
feel alive and aware, making people dangerous.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h5><i>You should 
buy a CrimethInc. product like you would buy a bomb&#151;to use it, dangerously!</i></h5>
