<h1>How to Get What You Want</h1>
<p><i>What do you want most in all the world? More money, a new car stereo, 
a vacation? To lose ten pounds, to get home from work in time to see your 
favorite sitcom? Or is it something more than that, something harder to 
define?</i> </p>
<p> Maybe you've given up on ever realizing your true dreams, and you settle 
for smaller things because they, at least, seem possible. Maybe it never 
occured to you to ask yourself if the goals you've been pursuing really 
are what you want most. Perhaps, like many people, you feel as if you 
are being compelled to do things, as if your life is not your own. How 
often do you feel like that? </p>
<p> Here's a wild idea: everything you do in your life, you should do because 
you want to do it, more than anything else in the world. And when you 
make plans, you should aim for the most exciting, glorious life you could 
imagine, not just for conventional "success" or "security," the consolation 
prizes of the tired and hopeless. What could be more radical than choosing 
your actions according to how enjoyable they are, rather than how moral, 
how responsible, how socially acceptable they seem? And yet, what else 
really makes sense? Haven't we tried serving every master but our own 
wishes, fighting for every cause except ourselves? Where has that gotten 
us? </p>
<p> Pursuing your desires doesn't just mean blindly following your impulses 
wherever they lead. It means, first, discovering what you really want: 
weeding through your desires and deciding which are real and which are 
illusory, which are stronger and which are weaker, which will bring you 
the most happiness in the end. It means reconstructing yourself and your 
life so that you can pursue as many of your desires as possible (since 
there is no guarantee that all of them can be simultaneously achieved&#151;most 
of us find ourselves always pulled in different directions by competing 
impulses and longings); it means prioritizing and analyzing your desires 
themselves. Maybe what you want is to feel better about yourself: is getting 
your nails done the answer, or could that impulse be a part of your insecurities? 
Perhaps you love the countryside; is it enough for you to buy a few acres 
of it and enjoy that, while the rest of the world is slowly wrapped in 
concrete? </p>
<p> Pursuing your desires also means reconstructing our society. Each of 
us is the product of the world we live in; and yet, this world is itself 
the product of our own efforts. To reconstruct yourself and your life, 
you must reconstruct the world that constructs and affects you, and for 
this you will need everyone else's help. If we want to pursue happiness, 
we should take responsibility for the world we are creating, and together 
make sure that it will be one that creates happiness in us. But won't 
doing whatever we want pit us against each other? No&#151;it will force us 
to work together. For the greatest, most ambitious endeavors cannot be 
carried through alone; they require the participation of other people, 
even of whole societies. Most of us want community, friendship, to feel 
safe and free with others more than almost anything else; we need each 
other to achieve all these things. To create a community in which each 
of us can live life to the fullest, we must make it possible for all of 
us to pursue our dreams and be free and creative. Otherwise we're cheating 
ourselves of each other's potential, as well as our own. That's the secret 
that the very unambitious "me generation" missed: past a certain point, 
greed and generosity intersect. </p>
<p> And yes, this will be hard, especially at first. Nothing is more difficult 
than pushing yourself to always be honest with yourself, demanding the 
most from yourself and from every day of your life. It will put us at 
odds with the existing order, that's for sure. But it's a struggle worth 
fighting if any is! A contest of the vast potential that each of us has, 
and the vaster potential that we all could have together, against everything 
in this world that is pointless, petty, ugly... </p>
<p> The alternative, of course, is to settle for what we have today, and 
never question whether there could be more to life. </p>
<p> Ultimately, happiness doesn't come from just getting what you want and 
having it, but rather from the process of seeking it&#151;from the free pursuit 
of your desires and ambitions. It's that feeling of excitement and weightlessness 
you experience when you feel free to do and be whatever you want, when 
life becomes a joyous, ever-changing dance. After centuries of dull servitude 
to responsibility, propriety, and necessity, we're not used to expressing 
and following our dreams&#151;the time has come to learn how. </p>
<p> Think back to the most important day of your life, the day you first 
discovered love or music or adventure... when a thousand new doors opened, 
and the world seemed bigger than it ever had before, and suddenly everything 
was possible. </p>
<h3>Why can't every day feel like that?</h3>
<p> Well, for one thing, we don't exactly live in a society that is designed 
to help us discern and pursue our hearts' desires, do we? Whatever the 
rhetoric about "freedom and the pursuit of happiness" may suggest, our 
society is filled to the point of absurdity with distractions and restrictions. 
We're all so busy struggling to keep up that it's hard to even remember 
our dreams, let alone chase after them. And each of us feels so powerless 
that it's equally hard to keep in mind that this world we live in is entirely 
the result of our own efforts: it is our work that has made it this way. 
Our species has completely transformed the planet. Is this the best of 
all possible worlds we have built? </p>
<p> If it's not, why don't we stop building it, and invent new ways of living 
and working together&#151;so we can construct another, better world, that will 
be more pleasurable for all of us! For what should we work towards, if 
not pleasure and joy?</p>
<p><i>Have you ever made love and it felt so good it seemed dangerous?<br>
Being in love means really wanting to live in a different world:<br>
a more exciting world, a more beautiful world, a more joyous, carefree 
world.<br>
A world where everything matters and nothing is ever, ever dull.<br>
Why shouldn't we start to build that world right here, today?</i></p>
