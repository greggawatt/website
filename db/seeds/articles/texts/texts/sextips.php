<h1>Sex Tips for Restless Youth</h1>
<p>Do you experience sexual problems? Do you have trouble getting aroused, 
or having sex that is fulfilling, or simply meeting the right partners 
to share that aspect of your life? Chances are you do&#151;just have a 
look at the magazine rack in any grocery store, and it's clear from all 
the advice columns and feature articles just how sexually lost and frustrated 
modern men and women are. Unfortunately, these magazines only offer symptomatic 
treatment (otherwise, they wouldn't have to run the same articles over 
and over every month!), no real, radical solutions. And to date, few people 
have really dared to be open about their troubles, thanks to the social 
pressures to be "successful" in all affairs. So, in keeping with our general 
program of providing aid wherever it is needed, we offer some tips: </p>
<p> --Stop trying to make your sexuality serve in your efforts to be a good 
citizen (responsive lover, macho man, etc.)&#151;it won't, it will just 
go on strike. Better to serve it, if serving must be done. </p>
<p> --Stop trying to make your sex life (or romance, or anything else, for 
that matter), by itself, provide you with qualities that should be intrinsic 
to every moment of your life. It is not the role of your sexuality to 
be your sole source of excitement, or intimacy, or pleasure&#151;it is 
the role of sex to be just that, to be sex. If you feel trapped or insecure 
or bored everywhere else, you will probably have a hard time shaking off 
those feelings in bed. </p>
<p> --If your idea of seventh heaven is having perfect sex with a beautiful 
partner, dispel it. Heaven cannot be an isolated moment of life; it has 
to be a complete way of living, or else it will be just another barren 
myth to denigrate and impoverish the moments of our real experience. Better 
that we find ways to make <i>every</i> moment of life as exciting as great 
sex can be (and believe me, it can be done!), considering that we can't 
have sex <i>all</i> the time&#151;such a thing would get boring, anyway, 
since living has so many facets we must not neglect! You can feel and 
share passion as deeply while building puppets for street demonstrations 
together, sneaking onto rooftops for late night conversations, or stowing 
away on ferryboats. Most people just haven't had the chance to be free 
and wild together anywhere outside the bedroom yet&#151;and consequently, 
it hardly comes naturally between the sheets. </p>
<p> --Rescue your sexuality from the definitions and delineations slipped 
around it like a noose by external forces: the leering billboards and 
romantic comedies, the expectations of your friends and parents and paramours, 
the television programs and other social programming devices that would 
dictate desire and limit the erotic to the strictly sexual. The powers 
that be have everything at stake in keeping your sexuality emaciated and 
confined to the specific act of physical intercourse, to one routine and 
one partner and one ghettoized category, so you won't discover in it the 
freedom that you could be living around the clock, outside their control, 
beyond their target markets. But one step outside the lines, and the world 
is yours. </p>
<p> --And that means throwing out your pornography. Pornography isn't obscene 
because it's sexual, but because it's <i>not</i>&#151;replace the representation 
with the <i>real,</i> in every instance, for maximum possibility. Masturbation 
is a beautiful thing, but don't let the pornography industry buy out your 
libido. A two-dimensional woman, no matter how trangressively posed, will 
do exactly what you command her and no more: that means she can never 
challenge you with her own needs or perspectives, never open new doors 
to you, never assert her selfhood. That refusal to be challenged is a 
rejection of the vast expanses of freedom that can only be reached with 
others. We should be wary of giving our fantasies such slaves to rule 
over, lest we learn to fetishize the violence of domination implied by 
such one-sided sex&#151;and end up living in the sterile, determinist 
world of control mania. Do you want to explore, to reach unimaginable 
climaxes, to try out things you've never seen in movies? Do it with other 
people&#151;they are out there. Let them know you're ready. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sexuality as art&#151;now there's a start. But more art "about" sexuality? 
It's doubtful that the world of images will ever belong to us again . 
. . that's just another diversion of our attention to that domain from 
this world, where we should be practicing doing, being, feeling with one 
another, not with the dangerous safety of an object. Make love and speak 
about your best kept secrets, your blackest needs, the demands the culture 
of fear places on your sexuality, held hostage as it is (never fear, you're 
not the only one who thinks you have things to hide&#151;your secret's 
safe with all of us!) . . . We can get out of here, together, but first 
we have to be honest to figure out where the fuck we are!</p>
<p><i> To find indulgences that simultaneously satisfy and subvert our programmed, 
poisonous desires, and thus remake ourselves&#151;that is the key.</i></p>
