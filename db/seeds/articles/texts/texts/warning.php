<h1>CrimethInc. Rhetoric Can Be Hazardous To Your 
Mental Health</h1>
<p>Intellectuals have quite an aptitude for displacement&#151;when they suffer 
from the ennui of their dry, disembodied existence, they respond to this 
suffering not with action but with more desiccating and disembodying. 
All too often their real discontent ends up being diverted into theory 
and abstract analysis, and from there back into career and status. . . 
and thus, more status quo. </p>
<p>Ideology creeps quickly into <i>any</i> language, languages that seek 
to oppose it no less. It might well be that the language of radical theory, 
dreary and unbearable as it was with so many academic code words and so 
much talk about "responsibility" and self-sacrifice and the inevitability 
of history, would have died out on its own (and right on time!) if we 
had not revitalized it with our reference to real life needs and fantasies. 
But now our innovation has become a routine of its own, and we all know 
what to expect from the mouth of any radical: the same old standard-issue 
rhetoric, but now even more disheartening, for it comes dressed in the 
robes of our own hearts and dreams. All the talk about joy and seizing 
pleasure and desiring freely seems as stilted and forced to our ears today 
as the Marxist class struggle diatribes of twenty years ago. You can talk 
all you want about spontaneity and pleasure, but once you've written the 
word "passion" a thousand times in redundant, repetitive demands for immediate 
change, it loses whatever power and beauty it had to start with. </p>
<p>So what can we do about all this?</p>
<h3>PRACTICE JOY NOW!</h3>
<p> . . .chants the chorus of anguished anarchist robots. Well, exactly&#8212;and, 
at the same time, no, not at all! For heaven's sake, if it's passion you 
want in your life, the last thing you should do is make up more slogans 
about it. This little disclaimer is itself a pernicious little thing, 
just more <i>talking</i> about talking about life&#8212;put the paper down, 
stop conceptualizing, and get out there and do something <i>real</i>, 
something that escapes the claws of routine! No more expounding, rationalizing, 
glorifying. . . distrust any words or symbols that attempt to capture 
the things that make life matter&#8212;political pomposity above all! Words 
can only hold reality <i>by accident,</i> and then only for brief moments. 
Cornered by the inertia of our own rhetoric, we must finally take a stand 
against description&#8212;and <i>for</i> expression, but in action alone, the 
only place where it can be free and unburdened by the dead weight of ideology. 
That is to say&#8212;it is only sufficient to speak when, by speaking, you <i>are</i> 
acting. So unless you have hit upon a way to turn all this theory into 
actual life&#8212;throw this treatise aside!<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('The treatise, of course, goes on from this point, undaunted, forgetful of its own demands, as ideology always does and is.', CAPTION, '[1]');" onmouseout="nd();">[1]</a>      </p>
