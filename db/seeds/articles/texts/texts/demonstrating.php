<h3>Talking Tactics: <br />
The Mass Action 
Model versus the Autonomous Action Model</h3>
<p>In 
the past six years, the North American anarchist movement 
has gone through all the stages of a turbulent love affair 
with mass actions, including messy breakups and attempted 
reconciliations. In the process, some anarchists have taken 
up with other approaches to demonstration activism&#8212;including, 
most notably, an emphasis on more autonomous, decentralized 
actions. In this review of the past year&#8217;s demonstrations, 
we&#8217;ll discuss the strengths and weaknesses of both 
approaches, and analyze how these have played out in the 
streets.</p><p> In considering how to evaluate both mass and autonomous 
actions, we should begin by establishing what it is fair 
to expect of them. Most anarchists thoughtlessly describe 
them as direct action, but, technically speaking, demonstrations&#8212;even 
confrontational, militant ones, in which police are forced 
out of neighborhoods, corporate property is set afire, and 
bureaucratic summits are shut down&#8212;are not direct 
action. Making love, growing or stealing food, providing 
free child care&#8212;these are concrete actions that directly 
accomplish their goals. Militant demonstration tactics, 
on the other hand, may qualify as direct action to the extent 
to which they circumvent liberal or police control to make 
a point or create an atmosphere outside the dictates of 
the powers that be, but most anarchists who participate 
in them would argue that their primary purpose is to bring 
closer the abolition of the hierarchies and institutions 
against which they are staged, and viewed in this light 
they are generally more symbolic than direct.<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('Setting out to shut down a capitalist summit and succeeding in doing so may qualify as direct action in the most immediate sense, but an anti-capitalist movement that succeeded in shutting down summit after summit without bringing any closer the abolition of capitalist social relations would be a failure, not a success. Hence, such feats ultimately have their greatest value as demonstrations of what is possible.', CAPTION, '[1]');" onmouseout="nd();">[1]</a></p><p> This is not to say that they are never worthwhile. Even 
if a demonstration doesn&#8217;t serve to solve immediately 
the problem it is staged to address, it can contribute to 
this process by spreading awareness, raising morale, exerting 
pressure on those opposed, and providing useful experience 
for participants. Not even a whole city of smashed windows 
could suffice to stop any one multinational corporation 
from wrecking the ecosystem and exploiting workers; but 
if a broken window serves to focus attention on an issue 
and inspire others to mobilize themselves, it at least qualifies 
as highly effective<em> indirect</em> action.</p><p> The protests against the meeting of the World Trade Organization 
in Seattle in November 1999 remain the most popular example 
of effective mass action in our time. Though countless pundits 
have typed themselves blue in the face on the subject, it 
is possible that anarchists have not yet finished refining 
the lessons of Seattle regarding the advantages of the mass 
action model and the elements that must be in place for 
it to work. The very fact that no mass action since Seattle 
has been as successful should make it easier for us to evaluate 
what made it a success, now that we have plenty of experience 
with actions that lacked those qualities.</p><p>What 
worked in Seattle and the mass demonstrations that followed 
it? When they were effective, what exactly did they accomplish, 
and how?</p><p>First, 
it&#8217;s important to understand that, unlike every mass 
action that followed it, the protests in Seattle benefited 
from the element of surprise. The powers that be had no 
idea what they were in for, the police were correspondingly 
unprepared, and, just as significantly, the corporate media 
didn&#8217;t know better than to broadcast the news of the 
victory far and wide. When subsequent protests failed to 
succeed in actually halting summit meetings, decimating 
shopping districts, or receiving international news coverage, 
this should not have come as a shock: the forces of repression 
were thoroughly prepared for them, and capitalist media 
moguls had learned it was not in their best interest to 
advertise anti-capitalist resistance as effective and exciting.</p><p>All 
the same, even without the element of surprise, subsequent 
mass actions were effective in some ways. They brought attention 
to anarchist ideas and resistance, enabled radicals to gain 
experience in militant tactics that were impossible in other 
contexts, and continued to build momentum and connections 
in insurgent communities.</p><p>The 
chief strengths of mass actions are due to the opportunities 
accorded by the concentration of many radicals and activists 
in one space. When a broad range of groups who regularly 
employ different tactics to address different issues come 
together, all can benefit from the ways their different 
approaches complement one another; not only this, but what 
they accomplish can easily be recognized as a part of a 
broad-ranging program, rather than a single-issue campaign. 
For radicals who are used to feeling like a powerless minority 
lost in a sea of apathy, the presence of many others of 
like minds can be intensely empowering. In large groups, 
people can inspire one another to find the courage and sense 
of entitlement necessary to act in ways they otherwise would 
not, and there is no shortage of potential comrades with 
whom to collaborate. When great numbers are present, radicals 
can plot large-scale strategies and achieve ambitious goals, 
and the achievement of these goals serves to attract future 
participants. So many beautiful people concentrated in one 
space can create a temporary real-life example of an anarchist 
society, something practically unimaginable for those who 
grew up in the sterile, colonized, hopeless environments 
of modern day capitalism.</p><p>The 
other really advantageous aspect of mass actions is that 
they are accessible and participatory. Because they can 
incorporate a wide range of tactics, they offer space for 
participants of a wide range of capabilities and comfort 
levels; and as they are announced openly and take place 
in public settings, people can join in without need of special 
social connections. Thus, they serve to create new connections 
between people and communities, and to provide points of 
entry for atomized individuals into a mass movement. Additionally, 
because so many people, both intentional participants and 
chance witnesses, experience them firsthand, news about 
mass actions spreads easily through word of mouth and other 
non-corporate channels. This makes it difficult for the 
corporate media to ignore them entirely without risking 
a loss of popular credibility.</p><p>The 
limitations of the mass action model also became clearer 
and clearer as the years passed after Seattle. Organizing 
events on such a large scale, not to mention traveling to 
them from a great distance, demands a lot of energy and 
resources, which must be drawn from the same pool of energy 
and resources upon which ongoing and locally-based projects 
depend. If a demonstration results in mass arrests, as the 
less militant civil-disobedience-oriented mass action models 
are wont to, this can consume time, money, and attention 
that might be more profitably applied to some constructive 
end; the same goes for the felony charges and arduous court 
cases that can result from individual arrests at more militant 
actions. The connections made at mass actions are more often 
between spatially distant, culturally homogenous communities 
than between local, culturally dissimilar ones that could 
benefit from continuing to work together outside the mass 
action format. It has been charged that, though they demand 
a lot of organizing from those in the host city, mass actions 
often drain more from local communities than they give to 
them. More insidiously, because the mass action model focuses 
on exceptional events that largely take place in well-known 
cities, it can foster the unhealthy impression that history 
is determined at special occasions in Washington, DC rather 
than in the decisions people everywhere make in their daily 
lives.</p><p>Because 
each mass action demands so much from so many, organizers 
who seek to put on major demonstrations must compete with 
one another for the privilege of getting to stage one of 
the few that can happen in any given period; under these 
conditions, it is easy for authoritarians to seize the reigns, 
or sabotage the labors of many with a few bad decisions. 
Because traveling great distances to events and risking 
arrest is not feasible for people of many walks of life, 
the mass action model has been criticized as the domain 
of privileged activists; this does not necessarily undercut 
the possibility that it can achieve worthwhile goals, but 
it does indicate certain limits to its effectiveness as 
outreach and as a participatory form of resistance.</p><p>Finally, 
and most significantly in the post-9/11 era, the mass action 
model enables authorities to prepare extensively, making 
every demonstration into a spectacle of their intimidating 
might. This gives the misleading impression that people 
are powerless in the grip of an all-powerful government, 
when in fact the state must draw troops from far and wide 
to stage these shows of force. It is especially convenient 
for intelligence-gathering departments to have so many radicals 
concentrated in one place, working on one project. Working 
publicly, in great numbers and under constant surveillance, 
it is very difficult for radicals to disseminate new tactical 
ideas without infiltrators and police apprehending them.</p><p>Knowing 
these limitations all too well, but not wishing to retire 
into inactivity, some activists argue in favor of more decentralized, 
autonomous actions. Generally speaking, an autonomous action 
is an action on a small enough scale that it can be organized 
without coordination from a central body, below the radar 
of the authorities. A classic modern day example of autonomous 
action is an attack on an army recruiting station, in which 
its windows are broken and slogans are spraypainted across 
its walls. Throughout this discussion, we will be addressing 
three basic kinds of autonomous action: actions carried 
out by individuals or individual affinity groups that take 
place entirely apart from mass actions; actions carried 
out by individuals or affinity groups that coincide with 
mass actions; and larger mobilizations, such as impromptu 
street marches, that are organized and initiated autonomously 
by small groups.</p><p>The 
autonomous action model has many advantages that mass actions 
lack: such actions almost always benefit from the element 
of surprise, they require significantly less infrastructure 
and preparation, and those who organize them can choose 
the time and terrain of engagement, rather than simply reacting 
to the decisions of the authorities. Autonomous actions 
are perfect for those with limited resources who do not 
desire to act in a high profile manner. They are practical 
and efficient for striking small blows and maintaining pressure 
on a broad range of fronts, and provide an excellent learning 
opportunity for small groups who wish to build up experience 
together.</p><p>In 
choosing to focus on this model, however, activists should 
also take into account the ways in which its advantages 
are also limitations. It is easy to maintain secrecy in 
preparing for an autonomous action, but it is often correspondingly 
difficult to spread word of it afterwards&#8212;let alone 
carry it out in a manner that offers those outside the immediate 
circle of organizers the chance to join in. While the autonomous 
action model is useful for those already involved in the 
direct action movement, it is rarely useful for helping 
others get involved or develop more experience. Without 
participatory, accessible forms of resistance, a movement 
cannot be expected to grow.</p><p>The 
essential idea of autonomous action&#8212;that individuals 
can organize their own activity, without need of direction 
or superstructure&#8212;is also the essence of anarchism. 
The problem here is that the essential challenge of spreading 
the autonomous action model is also the essential challenge 
of the anarchist revolution: most people are not used to 
acting on their own&#8212;without direction, organization, 
and the energy and sense of urgency that special events 
and large numbers of comrades provide, many find it difficult 
to cross over from hesitation into action. Even for those 
who hope to act autonomously, mass actions provide momentum, 
morale, crowd cover, legal support, numbers, media attention, 
and many other important elements. Outside the mass action 
model, we have to figure out how to do without these, or 
provide for them some other way.</p><p>Focusing 
on autonomous actions is a strategic retreat for radicals 
if it means dropping out of the public eye. Merely material 
blows, such as financial losses to corporations, will not 
suffice to topple the powers that be, at least at this juncture 
in the struggle; the hurricanes that struck the southeastern 
USA in the summer of 2004 did literally tens of thousands 
of times the financial damage of all the direct actions 
carried out that year combined, without posing any threat 
to the stability of the capitalist order. What is truly 
dangerous about anticapitalist resistance 
is not the actual effects of any given action, but the danger 
that it might become contagious and spread <a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('This is not to say that widely publicized but purely symbolic actions are sufficient to build a movement that can pose a threat to capitalism! To inspire others and attract future participants, militant actions must actually strike blows and accomplish immediate goals.', CAPTION, '[2]');" onmouseout="nd();">[2]</a>; 
and for this to be possible, people have to hear about resistance, 
and know how to join in. Too often, autonomous actions that 
are prepared and carried out in secret depend entirely on 
the media to publicize them. With the corporate media determined 
to limit coverage of direct action and independent media 
struggling to reach any audience beyond a few subcultural 
ghettos, this can be a serious flaw.</p>
<p>Even 
when they do attract attention, autonomous actions do not 
necessarily mobilize others. In the worst case, a direct 
action movement oriented around the autonomous actions of 
a dynamic few can degenerate into a sort of spectator sport. 
This is one of the many reasons most anarchists reject terrorism 
and other approaches that depend on the actions of a vanguard: 
for an action model to stand a chance of being useful in 
the project of revolutionary struggle, it must be possible 
for others to adopt and apply it themselves&#8212;indeed, 
it must promote and encourage this, it must seduce people 
into using it who might otherwise remain inactive.</p><p>Finally, 
while mass actions by their very nature involve and benefit 
from large-scale coordination, it is more difficult to coordinate 
effective decentralized actions. Clearly, as the past few 
years have shown, it&#8217;s not sufficient for some lone 
maniac to issue a &#8220;call for autonomous actions&#8221; 
for them to take place everywhere&#8212;or, and this might 
be even worse news, if they have been taking place everywhere, 
it doesn&#8217;t seem to have made any discernable difference. 
We need a model for autonomous actions that actually enables 
them to take place, and to be effective when they do. In 
the discussion that follows, we&#8217;ll analyze the lessons 
of the past year&#8217;s attempts to develop such a model.</p><p>In 
considering these issues, it&#8217;s important to emphasize 
that neither mass actions nor autonomous actions represent 
the only possible form of radical activity&#8212;they don&#8217;t, 
and shouldn&#8217;t, represent even the primary one. If 
a total moratorium on both could enable an accordingly greater 
focus on other activities such as the development of community 
infrastructure and alliances, it might be for the best for 
the anarchist movement; some have argued in favor of just 
that. If we continue to invest energy in demonstrations 
of any kind, it should be because they can, as part of a 
broader strategy, enable us to make gains on other fronts 
as well; this author, for one, feels strongly that this 
can be the case.</p>
<h3>Background: <br />
Direct Action at Demonstrations from 
the 1990&#8217;s to 2004</h3>
<p>Watershed 
events like the aforementioned protests in Seattle don&#8217;t 
just come out of nowhere. Throughout the apparently quiet 
1990&#8217;s, direct action groups like Earth First! and 
Anti-Racist Action were acting on a smaller scale, building 
up experience and momentum, while previously apathetic milieus 
like the punk rock scene and college activism were politicized 
by lifestyle politics and the anti-sweatshop campaign, respectively. 
Once Britain&#8217;s successes with the Reclaim the Streets 
model demonstrated that mass anti-capitalist action was 
still possible in the post-modern era, it was only a few 
months before activists tried to do something similar in 
the USA at the meeting of the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>The 
results surprised everybody. Suddenly, everyone had a working 
example of anti-authoritarian, anti-capitalist resistance 
as a reference point. Anarchists, among other radicals, 
came out of the woodwork, and everyone was itching to have 
a go at repeating that success. Because the Seattle protests 
had not been a mere fluke but rather the culmination of 
a long period of growth and development, there was a root 
structure in place to sustain further such actions&#8212;the 
most notable being the protests against the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C. the following 
April, against the Democratic and Republican National Conventions 
that summer, and against the Free Trade Area of the Americas 
summit in Quebec in April 2001. And because each demonstration 
attracted new attention and additional participants to the 
anarchist movement, the root structure quickly deepened 
and spread. The movement, focusing much of its energy on 
these convergences and mass actions, rode a wave that sometimes 
made it appear to be an unstoppable historical force.</p><p>By 
summer of 2001, when great numbers of people participated 
in streetfighting at the G8 summit in Italy and planning 
was underway for more protests against the IMF in Washington, 
DC, some felt that the movement had reached the crest of 
that wave. Many were exhausted from the demands of constant 
organizing, long-distance traveling, and court cases; at 
least as many felt that the anarchist movement was on the 
verge of a breakthrough that would change the nature of 
resistance in North America. We&#8217;ll never know whether 
or not the effectiveness of mass mobilizations had already 
reached its peak, for before the planned protests in DC 
could take place, hijackers flew airplanes into the World 
Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the entire context changed. 
The anarchist response to the new situation was, for the 
most part, embarrassing: rather than seizing the opportunity 
to emphasize that now even U.S. citizens were dying as a 
result of their rulers&#8217; foreign policies, many hesitated 
to speak out in fear that they would be attacked or seen 
as insensitive, and thus ceded all the gains made by anarchists 
over the preceding years. Fears ran rampant that new anti-terror 
legislation and enforcement would be used to imprison and suppress the anarchist movement, a concern that has since 
been shown to be unfounded<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('This was probably more of an irrational emotional reaction than a miscalculation. To the extent that it was a judgment call, it indicates that activists overestimated either the ability of the government to identify and repress them or the threat the government perceived them to pose.', CAPTION, '[3]');" onmouseout="nd();">[3]</a>. Now that 
most activists did not believe that positive revolutionary 
change could be around the corner, all the internal conflicts 
and burnout that had been building up over the preceding 
years of constant action came to the fore, and over the 
following months anarchist communities saw the worst infighting 
in recent history.</p>
<p>In 
retrospect, it is possible to argue that mainstream media 
attention was responsible for a significant part of the 
high morale and sense of entitlement that enabled anarchists 
to act so effectively in the period between the Seattle 
demonstrations and the 9/11 attacks. Few if any in the anarchist 
milieu have addressed this irony. In Western society, everyone 
is raised to desire, however secretly, to be famous&#8212;to 
be on television &#8211; because what is on television is 
&#8220;real,&#8221; is important. Although at the time many 
anarchists insisted they didn&#8217;t care whether or not 
they received coverage in the corporate media, it could 
be said that the simple knowledge that they were &#8220;famous&#8221; 
as a movement if not as individuals sustained their spirits 
and sense of urgency. When this attention was withdrawn, 
morale plummeted immediately. The corporate media is unlikely 
to return the spotlight to anarchist activity in the foreseeable 
future, and the motivation of anarchists should not be dependent 
upon other&#8217;s representations of them in the first 
place. Anarchists now must find ways to maintain momentum 
and energy even through a total media blackout.</p><p>As 
the anarchist movement struggled to regain its footing throughout 
the year following the 9/11 attacks, some tentative attempts 
were made to apply the mass action model again, notably 
at the protests against the World Economic Forum in New 
York City and then at the &#8220;People&#8217;s Strike&#8221; 
protests against the IMF in DC a year after the terrorist 
attacks. These were admirable efforts, and if nothing else 
they served to give those seriously committed to demonstration 
activism a way to stay involved, but they showed that for 
the most part the large numbers and high morale previously 
associated with large mobilizations were no longer available. 
Older activists were demoralized, younger ones were unsure 
how to proceed, and people on the fringes of activism and 
radical politics were too distracted by the spectator sport 
of the so-called War on Terror to refocus on the struggle 
against capitalist globalization on other fronts.</p><p>When 
the Terror War shifted into a new gear, demonstrations became 
popular again, but anarchists were no longer in the forefront 
of the organizing. Liberal and authoritarian groups attempted 
to appropriate all the mystique radicals had recently given 
mass action, while only taking on the superficial aspects 
of the organizing models that had made protests before 9/11 
exciting, participatory, and thus dangerous to the established 
order. The first two major demonstrations to protest the 
impending war in Iraq, in DC on January 20 and then worldwide 
on February 15, were dominated by liberal single-issue politics 
and models. The protests in New York City on February 15 
became a little more raucous when the police attempted to 
block the march and rank-and-file protesters fought back, 
but for the most part consciously radical 
militant tactics seemed a thing of the past at mass actions <a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('Another notable exception to this generalization occurred during an otherwise placid liberal march in Washington, DC when a small group of anarchists broke away, marched to the World Bank, charged into the building, and trashed it from the inside.', CAPTION, '[4]');" onmouseout="nd();">[4]</a>. This was all the more disappointing 
in that the February 15 protests were perhaps the most heavily 
attended protests in history; because militant activists 
had surrendered the mass action context, millions of people 
marching in the streets neither helped to sway the opinions 
of the masters of war nor to obstruct their preparations 
for it&#8212;nor, for that matter, to build a movement capable 
of disarming them.</p>
<p>Things 
changed when the United States attacked Iraq on March 20, 
2003. On this day, and over the months that followed it, 
countless cities were struck by demonstrations that went 
beyond the limits liberal organizers try to impose. San 
Francisco was entirely paralyzed; more importantly, radical 
communities appeared in more surprising locations such as 
Saint Louis, Missouri, conceiving and carrying out their 
own disruptive actions as the militant core of the anti-war 
movement. A new generation of activists, many of whom had 
not participated in the post-Seattle phase of demonstration 
activism, gained experience during this time.</p><p>As 
that phase of the war in Iraq died down, activists also 
slowed the pace of their activity, taking time to recover 
from such a demanding period of organizing. Anarchists nationwide 
began to focus their attention on the Free Trade Area of 
the Americas ministerial that was to take place in Miami 
the following November. Many believed that, thanks to the 
new momentum generated in the anti-war movement, this could 
be the first really effective, exciting demonstration against 
capitalist globalization since September 11; some hoped 
this would be the triumphant return of Seattle-style protest 
activism. Consultas were held around the country at which 
plans were hashed out, posters were designed and distributed, 
groups disseminated calls for various forms of action.</p><p>Unfortunately, 
Miami was a poorly chosen playing field for this grudge 
match. It was the most militarized police state North America 
had ever seen: there were so many police, equipped with 
so much destructive weaponry, that any kind of militant 
confrontation would have been doomed to failure. The protestor 
turnout was bound to be limited: the majority of potential 
participants were still distracted by the Iraq war, not 
thinking about corporate globalization, and Miami was a 
great distance from most active communities. Consequently, 
there wasn&#8217;t a wide range of diversity among the protestors, 
which can otherwise temper police repression: this made 
it easy for the police to pigeonhole protesters as either 
law-abiding union members or unruly anarchists, so as to 
ignore the former and attack the latter.</p><p>These 
factors alone might not have spelled doom for the protests, 
but there were also several strategic errors in the organizing. 
The plan organizers put forth, to attack 
the fence surrounding the meetings, was exactly what the 
authorities expected <a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('Protestors had applied this tactic at the previous FTAA ministerial in Quebec City, and met with some success, as it was fairly new at the time. By the time of the ministerial in Miami, however, fences had been attacked from Genoa to Cancun, and it was exactly what the authorities were expecting. As a general rule of thumb, it&#8217;s a bad idea to try an approach that worked or almost worked in a similar previous confrontation, assuming your opponents are in as much of a position to learn from the past as you are.', CAPTION, '[5]');" onmouseout="nd();">[5]</a>&#8212;and while 
the latter were thoroughly prepared for this scenario, few 
activists arrived mentally or physically equipped to undertake 
this. Even worse, certain organizers cut an unbelievably 
foolish deal with the labor unions&#8212;which, it must 
be noted, were closely collaborating with the police&#8212;to 
the effect that no direct action would take place during 
the permitted union march on the afternoon of the primary 
day of demonstrations. Thanks to this agreement, the police 
were free simply to maintain order during the union march, 
with little fear of having to divide their attention; then, 
as soon as the march was over, they steamrolled across the 
entire city, beating, gassing, shooting, and arresting everyone 
who remained, confident that everyone they attacked was 
acting outside the law and therefore a safe target. The 
only way anarchists could have turned the tables would have 
been by acting unexpectedly and en masse outside the occupied 
district of Miami, but the initiative necessary for that 
kind of autonomous, covert organizing was painfully lacking. 
The consulta model, while it indicated an admirable commitment 
to decentralized organizing, failed to provide intelligent 
strategic decisions, adequate security for planning, or 
commitments on which participating groups actually followed 
through. These may all have been incidental failures, but 
each one cost dearly.</p>
<p>This 
is not to say nothing of value was accomplished in Miami. 
People still came together and acted courageously, with 
all the benefits that entails, and the police state was 
revealed for what it was, at least to eyewitnesses and through 
the few venues that ran coverage of the events. But coming 
away from a protest with a martyr&#8217;s tale of police 
violence and abuse, or, at best, a story of heroic narrow 
escapes, is a poor second to actually feeling like one has 
struck blows and made gains.</p><p>In 
the wake of what many felt to be a debacle, some anarchists 
began to emphasize the importance of acting outside mass 
models in smaller, more autonomous groups with the element 
of surprise. Some had been promoting this idea for a long 
time; it had even been tested to some extent in mass actions, 
such as at the People&#8217;s Strike in Washington, DC, 
September 2002, when the organizers distributed a list of 
targets and intersections and announced that actions would 
take place throughout the city. Others, notably environmental 
and animal liberation activists, had been acting in clandestine 
cells for decades. So it happened that, as the election 
year approached, the war in Iraq wore on, and political 
matters came back to the fore of public attention, anarchists 
were preoccupied with the question of whether mass actions 
could ever be effective again, and what forms of decentralized 
action might be able to replace them.</p>
<h3>Direct Action in the Election Year</h3>
<p>The 
year 2004 was ushered in by a midnight march in downtown 
Washington, DC, commemorating the ten year anniversary of 
the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, Mexico. More than one 
hundred masked anarchists bearing banners, torches, and 
percussion instruments took over a major thoroughfare for 
a full hour, leaving spraypaint and stencil designs in their 
wake. This march appeared as if out of nowhere in a crowded 
business district, on a night when the police department 
was so overextended that it took over a half hour for even 
one patrol car to show up. There were no arrests. Clearly, 
some anarchists had learned the lessons of Miami, without 
withdrawing from public actions altogether.</p><p>All 
the same, the first months of 2004 were quiet ones for direct 
action. March 20th, the anniversary of the declaration of 
war on Iraq, saw largely peaceful mass demonstrations along 
the lines of those before the war, lacking the urgency and 
militancy of the actions carried out during it. In April, 
there was another protest in Washington, DC against the 
IMF and World Bank; the extent to which it was a ritualized, 
placid affair revealed just how far anarchist attention 
had drifted from the formerly prioritized terrain of mass 
actions opposing corporate globalization. It was followed 
immediately by the March for Women&#8217;s Lives, a rally 
in support of abortion rights that drew over a million people. 
Although there were hundreds of anarchists present, if not 
more, the possibility that militant action of any kind might 
take place was never broached. People of militant perspectives 
were still coming together when liberal organizers solicited 
their participation, but without a sense that it was feasible 
to organize events on their own terms.</p><p>This 
impression was sealed by the G8 summit in Georgia that June. 
The protests at the G8 summit in Genoa, Italy in the summer 
of 2001 had been the high water mark of the anti-globalization 
movement: hundreds of thousands of protesters had converged 
on the city, engaging in tactics of all kinds that had left 
entire financial districts in wreckage. Eager to avoid another 
such catastrophe, the powers that be picked a secluded island 
off the coast of Georgia to host the G8 meeting in June 
of 2004, and set aside tens of millions of dollars for security. 
Not only the island itself but much of the coastline around 
it was thoroughly militarized; as has become customary, 
the media ran a series of articles demonizing predicted 
anarchist protestors while emphasizing the invincibility 
of the police and military forces that would be waiting 
for them.</p><p>Demoralized 
by the Miami experience, most advocates of direct action 
assumed from the outset that nothing would be possible in 
Georgia. In retrospect, it was wise to let the G8 summit 
pass rather than squandering the last optimism of the movement 
on a doomed venture, though at the time this resignation 
seemed to be a troubling symptom of general cynicism. Many 
brushed off mass actions as obsolete; in the end, there 
was only one protestor for every sixty-seven security officers 
at the G8 summit. Much of the energy of those few who did 
take the trouble to go to Georgia was invested in the &#8220;Fix 
Shit Up&#8221; campaign, in which anarchists provided volunteer 
labor supporting disadvantaged families in the areas of 
police occupation. The name of this venture, which could 
neither successfully solicit media coverage nor appeal to 
liberal sympathies nor inspire the punk rockers whose slogan 
it referenced, speaks volumes as to its long-term effectiveness 
as an insurrectionary strategy. When no actual blows can 
be struck against the system that creates and enforces poverty, 
anarchists should at least do what they can to alleviate 
its effects&#8212;but many anarchists are already doing 
this where they live, and traveling long distances to do 
so has all the disadvantages of traveling to carry out more 
militant actions without most of the advantages. In every 
aspect, the G8 summit was the nadir of the general slump 
through which mass action activism passed following 9/11, 
notwithstanding the renaissance during the Iraq war.</p><p>Some 
had called for widespread autonomous actions around the 
country to coincide with the G8 summit. A little-known example 
of one such call was the &#8220;Insurrection Night&#8221; 
proposal, which was circulated via email listservs. In incendiary 
language, it called for people everywhere to carry out militant, 
confrontational direct actions the Saturday night preceding 
the week of the G8 summit. The advantages of this approach 
over going to Georgia to get tear-gassed and arrested in 
the middle of nowhere were obvious: it allowed radicals 
to plan their actions in familiar, unguarded terrain and 
with the benefit of surprise. On the night so designated, 
however, nothing happened&#8212;or if anything did, news 
of it was never circulated. If all it took to get people 
to rise up and strike blows against the apparatus of control 
was to issue a call to action, this revolution would have 
been over a long time ago; and even if such calls were to 
work, it seems clear that the system can survive a burning 
dumpster here and there&#8212;the problem is how to concentrate 
such blows, and strike them in such a way that they give 
rise to wider uprisings. From this example, one can surmise that 
both calls for autonomous action and autonomous actions 
themselves must proceed from an already thriving culture 
of resistance if they are to offer any results <a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('One person or group calling for others to act is little better than a vanguard, and can be expected to meet with as much success as the various communist splinter groups currently do. Calls for decentralized actions work best when activists who are already organizing themselves call upon others in their networks to join in, offering the opportunity to be part of an effort that already has participation and momentum in its favor.', CAPTION, '[6]');" onmouseout="nd();">[6]</a>&#8212;and 
neither, alone, are sufficient to give rise to such a culture. 
If the G8 summit in Georgia was the nadir for mass action, 
the &#8220;Insurrection Night&#8221; prototype represents 
the weakest version of the autonomous action model.</p>
<p>A 
few days after the proposed night of insurrection, on the 
final day of the G8 summit, activists in North Carolina 
shut down an entire corporate business district with steel 
cables, smoke bombs, and banners decrying the G8 and corporate 
power in general, causing a massive traffic jam in the center 
of the state. Local newspapers and television gave this 
more coverage than they gave the protests in Georgia against 
the G8 summit, and local residents experienced it far more 
immediately. This took place only two days before a public 
outreach event, the &#8220;Really Really Free Market,&#8221; 
in the state capital, at which people gathered to share 
resources and entertainment freely. As a result of the direct 
action that preceded it, the police and media both paid 
a great deal of attention to this event: the nightly news 
showed hundreds of people happily dancing, eating, and exchanging 
gifts, while police helicopters circled overhead and a hundred 
riot police waited nearby. Thus, this combination of tactics 
resulted in free publicity for the effectiveness of covert 
action, the munificence of community activism, and the heavy-handedness 
of the state. In contrast to the &#8220;Insurrection Night&#8221; 
prototype, this can be seen as an effective integration 
of autonomous action into a wider strategy for building 
radical communities and gaining widespread attention.</p><p>Another 
example of effective autonomous action occurred a month 
later in Maine, following an Earth First! gathering, when 
approximately 150 people converged on the Governor&#8217;s 
Mansion to protest a proposed liquid natural gas pipeline. 
First, a few activists erected a thirty-foot tripod with 
a protester locked atop it, blocking the driveway. Once 
this was accomplished and all but the police liaison and 
the woman on the tripod had escaped unseen, a small masked 
group arrived and took advantage of the distraction occasioned 
by the tripod to dump hundreds of pounds of foul lobster 
guts across the lawn. They disappeared as other protesters 
showed up with food, games, and other festive forms of entertainment, 
further confusing the slowly responding authorities. Two 
communiqu&eacute;s were delivered: one a serious one for 
the mainstream media, the other a hilarious statement on 
behalf of the &#8220;lobster liberation front&#8221; for 
activists and others with a sense of humor. The event helped 
keep opposition to the pipeline visible, gave those opposing 
it more bargaining power, and demonstrated an alternate 
model for autonomous actions.</p><p> The Maine action was organized in secrecy by a small circle 
of people who nonetheless managed to open it up to great 
numbers of participants; in this regard, it possessed many 
of the advantages of both the mass and autonomous action 
models. As the target was three hours&#8217; drive distant 
from the gathering at which participants were recruited, 
and its identity was never openly revealed, the action retained 
the element of surprise. At the gathering, two preparatory 
meetings were held at which organizers described the general 
nature of the target and affinity groups formed to focus 
on different aspects of the action. The morning of the action, 
a caravan left the gathering; the bulk of the participants 
did not know where they were going until they were led onto 
the site. This negated the risk of informers being present.</p><p>This 
kind of organizing demands a careful balance of security 
and communication, for those invited must learn enough about 
the action to be excited about participating and equipped 
to do so effectively. This model requires a large number 
of people to place a high level of trust in a few individuals; 
thus, it often works best in tight-knit or culturally homogeneous 
communities. While it is not as accessible to broad ranges 
of people as the mass action model, it is more participatory 
than other forms of autonomous action, offering introductory 
roles for less experienced activists.</p><p>The 
events in North Carolina and Maine were only two of several 
local actions in mid-2004; but for radical activists and 
well-behaved citizens alike, the central political events 
of the summer were the Democratic and Republican National 
Conventions. At these, the possibilities and limitations 
of the anarchist movement&#8217;s preoccupation with autonomous 
actions were tested.</p><p>The 
Democratic National Convention took place in Boston at the 
end of July. It was not heavily attended by radicals; many 
were saving their time and energy for the Republican National 
Convention. Regardless of theoretical matters such as whether 
anti-authoritarians should focus on contesting the most 
powerful political party or all political parties, activists 
laying plans for mass actions must take into account practical 
questions such as how many people will actually show up. 
Perhaps if thousands of anarchists had converged on Boston 
to show their opposition to the false alternative represented 
by the Democratic Party, it would have made an important 
point, but this was not to be. As many learned in Miami, 
anarchists must always devise strategies that take into 
account the number of participants an event will draw and 
how much militancy can realistically be expected of them.</p><p>To 
get perspective on the protests at the Democratic National 
Convention, we can compare and contrast them with the People&#8217;s 
Strike protests against the International Monetary Fund 
in DC September 2002, with which they shared many features. 
Both protests were less attended than organizers hoped; 
both included calls for autonomous action, as well as organizing 
for more centralized, accessible events; both took place 
in cities that are known for having police that show restraint 
during protests. At each event, the main day of action featured 
a critical mass bicycle parade, a march, and decentralized 
actions around the periphery. Both protests were organized 
by explicitly anti-authoritarian groups that made media 
coverage an integral part of their strategy.</p><p>The 
organizers of the People&#8217;s Strike had emphasized the 
confrontational character of their action, declaring explicitly 
that the city would be shut down; the unapologetically militant 
tone of their rhetoric was one of the most salient features 
of that mobilization. Although it turned out that not enough 
militants, and not militant enough ones at that, turned 
out to follow through on this threat, the media and police 
accomplished it themselves by spreading hysteria in advance 
and clogging up the city in their attempts to defend it. 
After most of the actions planned had been accomplished, 
the police, still unnerved and always most likely to go 
after defenseless sitting targets, mass-arrested everyone 
present at a non-confrontational action in Pershing Park. 
This mass arrest, though somewhat inconvenient at the time, 
proved to be the most important legacy of the action: it 
ensured international media coverage for the protest, made 
the police look absurd, and ensnared the city in lawsuits 
that kept the demonstration in the news for years afterwards 
and forced the police to be more hesitant to make arrests 
during future protests.</p><p>By 
contrast, in Boston, the organizers&#8212;the &#8220;Bl(A)ck 
Tea Society&#8221;&#8212;were careful to distance themselves 
from violence, striving to offset the media 
campaign of extreme misinformation about anarchists that 
had become typical by that time <a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('Seriously, where do they get this stuff? No anarchists have sprayed urine or acid on police officers in the entire recorded history of the current anarchist movement, and yet every corporate newspaper has dutifully repeated these lies as gospel.', CAPTION, '[7]');" onmouseout="nd();">[7]</a>. Presumably, 
they hoped that by doing so they could attract more participants; 
unfortunately, as the prevailing sentiment in liberal circles 
was that getting &#8220;anybody but Bush&#8221; elected 
president was the first priority, participation in protests 
against the Democratic Party was bound to be limited to 
radicals. The Boston organizers were also kept on edge by 
a campaign of police and FBI intimidation, but this never 
panned out into the raids and arrests they feared. The fact 
that there were so few arrests in Boston indicates that, 
however intimidating the police made certain to be before 
and during the event, they themselves hoped to avoid illegal 
raids and mass arrests that would draw more attention to 
the protests. Had the organizers figured this out in advance, 
they could have strategized accordingly.</p>
<p>Following 
the People&#8217;s Strike model, the organizers in Boston 
distributed a list of targets throughout the city suitable 
for autonomous action. However, in preparing the People&#8217;s 
Strike, the organizers had also covertly coordinated many 
actions, so as to be sure that something would happen&#8212;consequently, 
there were freeways shut down by burning tires, bank windows 
smashed, locks glued, and a major avenue barricaded by a 
giant inflatable, though many of these actions went unnoticed 
by the media or other activists because they took place 
over such a broad area. In Boston, the organizers don&#8217;t 
seem to have been as proactive, and neither, apparently, 
were many of the other activists who came to the protest&#8212;the 
most militant action of the event seems to have been an 
incident in which a dozen people turned over shelves in 
a Gap clothing store, leaving spraypaint in their wake.</p><p>Just 
as the &#8220;Insurrection Night&#8221; model failed to 
yield results, simply distributing a list of targets is 
hardly sufficient to enable militant action to occur. If 
they hope to see militant autonomous actions carried out 
to the extent that mass actions have been in the past, organizers 
must provide some of the prerequisites that enable people 
to apply militant tactics in the latter context. These include 
crowd cover, communications and scouting, media attention, 
and, above all, the reassurance that somebody somewhere 
has actually invested energy in making sure something will 
happen. The Bl(A)ck Tea Society attracted the necessary 
media attention; they provided a text messaging communications 
system, though it proved vulnerable to police surveillance, 
resulting in a few arrests after a botched attempt to assemble 
following the &#8220;Really Really Democratic Bazaar&#8221;; 
they seemed to have done little else to facilitate autonomous 
actions. This is not to disparage their organizing efforts&#8212;in 
addition to media and outreach work, they also organized 
a convergence center, prepared legal infrastructure, and 
staged a variant on the Really Really Free Market model 
that attracted thousands of participants. But if autonomous 
action is to rival mass action as a model for militant activity, 
anarchists have to learn that the &#8220;clap your hands 
if you believe in Tinkerbelle&#8221; approach, in which 
organizers call for decentralized actions and then cross 
their fingers and hope an army of maniacs will show up to 
plan and execute them, does not produce results.</p><p>The 
Democratic National Convention was not an opportune setting 
for a doomsday showdown with the forces of law and order, 
and it&#8217;s important that a movement limited in numbers 
and experience not overextend itself. Perhaps anarchists 
should have concentrated all their energy on accessible, 
non-confrontational approaches in Boston; it certainly doesn&#8217;t 
pay to make empty threats too many times. If effective militant 
action of any kind was to happen there, given the massive 
police presence and small numbers of protesters, it would 
have had to have been decentralized and autonomous: twenty 
such actions as happened at the Gap, for example, could 
have caught the police by surprise, generated media attention, 
and raised morale in anticipation of the Republican National 
Convention. Failing that, it would have been more sensible 
to focus on more outreach and community-building, in which 
the Boston protests were already superior to the People&#8217;s 
Strike. In trying to have it both ways by calling for militant 
action while neither preparing it nor tricking the police 
into making it unnecessary, the organizers played into the 
hands of the authorities, who hoped to show that they could 
easily thwart anarchist attempts at disruption. This had 
negative consequences for Boston locals as well as the anarchist 
movement. While the long-term effects of the &#8220;People&#8217;s 
Strike&#8221; were that local police became more hesitant 
in dealing with crowds, the millions of dollars of funding 
that the Boston police received to prepare for the convention 
paid for an arsenal of semi-lethal weapons&#8212;one of 
which was used to kill a woman during a post-game sports 
riot a few months later.</p><p>A 
month after the protests in Boston, the Republican National 
Convention was held in New York City. Unlike every other 
demonstration since the invasion of Iraq, this was a historic 
opportunity for anarchists to apply the mass action model 
effectively. All the necessary pieces were in place: the 
local populace was furious with the Republicans for invading 
their city, and enthusiastically supportive of the protesters; 
radicals were coming by the thousands from all around the 
country, hoping this would be the event of a lifetime; and 
there was to be a wide range of people involved in the protests 
and a great deal of media attention focused on them, both 
of which would help deter the police from a violent crackdown 
such as the one in Miami the preceding year. The attention 
of the whole world was concentrated on New York City, and 
while many liberals feared that a serious confrontation 
there would undermine the chances of the Democratic Party&#8217;s 
presidential hopeful, countless others longed for one.</p><p>If 
all that wasn&#8217;t enough, there was a struggle going 
on between the liberal organizers and the city police department 
as to whether the giant permitted march would be allowed 
to go to Central Park. This was the same situation that 
had precipitated the street confrontations during the anti-war 
protests in New York a year and a half earlier; if the city 
was unable to reach an agreement with the organizers in 
time, everyone knew that the march could turn violent. The 
leaders of the liberal organizing coalition backed down 
on their demands on one occasion, only to be forced by their 
grassroots membership to reinstate them. This conflict provided 
a perfect opportunity for anarchist organizing. A nationwide 
call for a black bloc on the day of the main permitted march 
would have taken perfect advantage of this conflict, giving 
those frustrated with the city government and its liberal 
accomplices a rallying point. Had the first major day of 
protests ended in streetfighting, it would have changed 
the entire character of the protests and perhaps of opposition 
to the Bush regime in general. The very last thing the police 
department of New York City wanted was to have to use tear 
gas in the crowded streets of the most populated city in 
North America; this would have been a public relations debacle 
for both the city government and the Republican Party, and 
it would have shown that anarchists could pose a real threat 
to the imposed domestic peace that enables wars overseas. 
Even if this had resulted in massive numbers of arrests, 
it could have been worth it&#8212;hundreds, if not more, 
of the anarchists who went to New York ended up getting 
arrested, anyway.</p><p>Alas, 
anarchists were so caught up in solving strategic problems 
from past actions that they failed to apprehend these possibilities. 
While a heavier focus on autonomous actions would have been 
the only hope of enabling effective militant tactics at 
the demonstrations in Miami and Boston, New York was a perfect 
setting for a large-scale, centrally organized strategy, 
and anarchists passed this chance up in favor of a focus 
on decentralized, autonomous actions. Perhaps older activists 
were still shell-shocked from the protests at the Republican 
National Convention in 2000, at which a poorly planned mass 
action had ended in a lot of pointless, demoralizing arrests; 
perhaps it was just too difficult to coordinate actions 
centrally between groups from around the world in such an 
enormous and complicated city; perhaps it really was the 
legacy of Miami frightening anarchists out of using their 
heads. Regardless, as the communiqu&eacute; delivered weeks 
before the demonstrations by the NYC Anarchist Grapevine 
admitted, there was no &#8220;Big Plan&#8221; for militant 
action in New York.</p><p>Unfortunately, 
what anarchists fail to coordinate themselves will be coordinated 
by authoritarians, and so, while anarchist labor was central 
to the infrastructure that enabled them, the character of 
most of the actions planned for New York was non-confrontational, 
even liberal. At the last minute, the organizers of the 
main march finally accepted the conditions of the city, 
agreeing to march in circles rather than follow through 
on the desires of the rank-and-file who wanted to go to 
Central Park with or without a permit; likewise, though 
anarchists and militants swelled the numbers of many other 
actions, these were largely orchestrated to avoid actually 
challenging the activities of the Republicans or the occupation 
of the city.</p><p>To 
be fair, some anarchists, notably including many who had 
traveled from San Francisco and other parts of the West 
Coast, organized a day of direct action late in the protests, 
but they focused only on enabling symbolic tactics of civil 
disobedience. Worse, they made exactly the same mistake 
that had been made in Miami and at the Republican National 
Convention four years earlier: they arranged for their action 
not to coincide with any others and to take place after 
most of the less radical protesters had left the city, so 
the police had free hands to focus on repressing everyone 
on the streets that night. This resulted in over one thousand 
arrests, without any concrete objective being accomplished 
besides the news coverage these attracted and the harassment 
of some Republican delegates.</p><p>One 
of the most important lessons that can be drawn from the 
aforementioned action is the importance of different kinds 
of actions taking place simultaneously. In Seattle, Quebec, 
and Genoa, legal marches, civil disobedience, and confrontational 
militant action all took place at once, and the division 
of the city into zones according to level of risk made it 
possible for protesters to pick the form of engagement with 
which they were most comfortable. In the Republican National 
Conventions of both 2000 and 2004, as well as the FTAA protests 
in Miami, organizers did exactly the opposite, senselessly 
endangering those committed to militant action and undercutting 
the effectiveness of the protests as a whole. The costs 
of this could have been offset had militants organized a 
major mass action themselves, but none dared do so.</p><p>In 
the absence of a unified approach, the hundreds of different 
actions that took place in New York never quite added up 
to the insurrection they could have. As a demonstration 
of the possibilities of localized autonomous action, New 
York was unparalleled, but it was also a missed opportunity 
in an era that provides few good chances to apply the mass 
action model.</p><p>Two 
groups did attempt to organize actions on the day of the 
main march; ironically, one applied the mass action model 
as if carrying out an autonomous action, while the other 
did exactly the opposite. The former of these groups was 
a militant contingent, apparently organized by word of mouth, 
that took part in the main permitted march; this might be 
the first case on record of a black bloc going undercover 
by mixing with civilian protesters and leaving their faces 
uncovered until the moment before the action. When this 
group approached the point at which the march turned around 
to march away from Central Park, right in front of the building 
hosting the convention center, an enormous green dragon 
puppet was set afire, and streetfighting broke out; however, 
there were not enough numbers or preparation to maintain 
this. Within an hour, the police had reestablished control 
and the march proceeded as before; only a few impressive 
photographs of the fire remained, one of which ran in one 
especially poorly informed tabloid with a caption describing 
it as the work of &#8220;the anarchist group &#8216;Black 
Box&#8217;.&#8221;<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('In another hilarious and ironic development, it turned out that there was a theater group in New York for the protests under the moniker Greene Dragon Society. Scrambling to give the impression that they were in control of the situation, the FBI announced that it had infiltrated the &#8220;Green Dragon Group&#8221; over a year earlier and were abreast of all its nefarious plans; this could only be to the misfortune of both the aforementioned liberal group and the FBI, however, as the Greene Dragon Society doesn&#8217;t appear to have been anywhere near the puppet that went up in flames, nor to have had anything to do with its construction. A more likely story was circulated by Starhawk of the pagan cluster, who was engaged in a spiral dance a block away when the dragon caught fire; she speculates that it was the energy released from their ritual that triggered the conflagration.', CAPTION, '[8]');" onmouseout="nd();">[8]</a></p>
<p>The 
other notable militant effort that day was a call for anarchists 
to intercept Republican delegates on their way to their 
evening&#8217;s entertainment at several Broadway shows. 
However, because this call was promoted in such venues as 
the New York Times, these actions lacked the element of 
surprise, the most important aspect of the autonomous action 
model. Many anarchists showed up, but as there was no strategy 
for mass action and few participants brought individual 
plans of their own, there were many arrests and little more 
was accomplished than a few delegates being shouted at.</p><p>Whatever 
strategic miscalculations anarchists may have made, it was 
still thrilling to be in New York with so many others determined 
to change the course of history. The Critical Mass bicycle 
parade, which took place before most of the other events, 
offered a moving illustration of just how many people and 
how much energy were gathered together that week; to stand 
at a corner and watch groups of thirty and forty surge constantly 
past for a full half hour was simply breathtaking. Most 
who went to New York left with new energy and inspiration, 
which helped to catalyze further action as the elections 
drew near.</p>
<p>The 
election provided a matchless opportunity for nationwide 
autonomous actions. Unlike any summit or local issue, it 
happened everywhere at once, focusing public attention on 
a wide range of issues that could be addressed on a variety 
of fronts. Among others, a nationwide campaign on the theme 
&#8220;Don&#8217;t (Just) Vote, Get Active&#8221; urged 
people to take action on election day to 
demonstrate all the possibilities for political engagement 
beyond the voting booth<a class="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="return overlib('Some few anarchists, mostly of the persuasion given to hyper-radical rhetoric and little action to back it up, were critical of this campaign on the grounds that it was too soft on voting. Indeed, insofar as people conflate it with actual political participation, voting is extremely pernicious&#8212;as every text circulated by the &#8220;Don&#8217;t (Just) Vote&#8221; campaign emphasized. That being the case, these critics seem to have been raising a new and daring question: entirely apart from the dangerous superstitions associated with it, can voting itself, taken in a vacuum, be harmful? Your humble editor, anxiously concerned about such safety issues, has done quite a bit of research on this subject and has finally turned up some evidence that this may be the case, if only in extreme situations. A dissident account of the untimely death of Edgar Allen Poe, advanced most recently in the amusing miscellany Why Americans Zigzag When They Eat, suggests that the renowned author was killed by being voted to death. In those days, political gangs would rig elections by shanghaiing vulnerable gentlemen and liquoring or doping them up to make them agreeable. On election day, these unfortunates would be frog-marched around to all the polling stations as fast as possible; once one circuit was completed, their handlers would change their clothes, trim their mustaches, and run them around again. The faster the pace they kept, the more votes they were worth, so it must have been a grueling process. (Nowadays, political gangs bypass such clumsy methods and accomplish the same thing with advertising and voting machine fraud.) Poe was known for his stylish dressing, but when he was found&#8212;drunk, delirious, and in the process of dying of exhaustion, at a Baltimore bar that doubled as a polling station&#8212;he was wearing a very cheap suit that didn&#8217;t seem to belong to him. It was an election day. So there you have it: voting, horror of capitalist horrors, killed the greatest horror writer of all time&#8212;and might kill you, too, if you put too much stock in it.', CAPTION, '[9]');" onmouseout="nd();">[9]</a>.</p>
<p>The 
diversity and scope of the actions anarchists carried out 
around the election make it worth recounting some of them 
here. In Washington, DC, fifteen polling stations were decorated 
the night before election day with a stencil design fifteen 
feet long and four feet high reading &#8220;Our dreams will 
never fit in their ballot boxes.&#8221; In Baltimore, the 
following afternoon, a Reclaim the Streets action on the 
same theme attracted sixty people.</p><p>In 
Portland, Oregon, one thousand people struggled with police 
to march through the streets. A &#8220;Don&#8217;t Just 
Vote, Take Action&#8221; march of two hundred people in 
Tucson, Arizona was attacked by police employing pepper 
bullets. A spontaneous march of almost two hundred people 
in downtown Philadelphia blocked a major bridge to New Jersey; 
everyone escaped arrest except a reporter from a local television 
news station who was inexplicably attacked by police while 
marchers chanted &#8220;We don&#8217;t need no water, let 
the motherfucker burn!&#8221; In New Orleans, a radical 
Day of the Dead march featuring a marching band, seventy-five 
skeletons, and an alter screamed and moaned its way through 
the French Quarter to the riverfront, at which the alter 
was filled with remembrances of deceased loved ones and 
then set afire as a naked attendant swam it out to sea; 
on the return route, participants dragged newspaper boxes 
and garbage cans into the streets and smashed the window 
of a stretch-SUV deemed too revolting to ignore.</p><p>During 
Chicago&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t Just Vote Week of Resistance,&#8221; 
which included several demonstrations and other events, 
police tried and failed to prevent over one thousand people 
from taking the streets in a massive unpermitted march. 
At another incident in Chicago, a rock was thrown through 
the window of a GOP office in which Republicans were gathered 
to watch election results, sending glass flying all over 
the room. Large rocks were also thrown through the windows 
of the Republican headquarters in downtown Buffalo, New 
York and a nearby army recruiting center, and the local 
news station received a letter claiming responsibility.</p><p>In 
Red Hook, New York, 250 Bard college students shut down 
an intersection in the center of town for almost an hour 
until police forcibly dispersed them. In northern Los Angeles 
county, a group carried out what they suggested might be 
the first banner drop in their area, with a banner on the 
&#8220;Don&#8217;t (Just) Vote&#8221; theme reading &#8220;Workers: 
Which Millionaire Will You Vote For?&#8221; In Vermillion, 
South Dakota, a town of only 10,000 residents, fifty people 
maintained a presence outside a voting booth, stretching 
a volleyball net to bear a variety of signs, sharing food, 
and inviting all with grudges of their own against the system 
to join them. The same town was to host another such demonstration 
two and a half months later on the day of the Inauguration, 
attracting media coverage from as far away as San Diego, 
CA.</p><p>The 
day after the election, a march in downtown Washington, 
DC on the theme &#8220;No Matter, Who Won, The System Is 
Rotten&#8221; attracted one hundred people. Equipped with 
a powerful sound system, it snaked through the streets, 
disruptive and rowdy, evading police repression. In San 
Francisco, five thousand people marched against Bush; afterwards, 
a breakaway group built a bonfire out of US flags and an 
effigy of Bush, then marched through the city pulling urban 
debris and newspaper boxes into the street and smashing 
the windows of two banks. In San Diego, fliers posted the 
preceding night on UCSD campus reading &#8220;Where&#8217;s 
the Riot?&#8221; attracted one hundred people to an impromptu 
forum as to what forms resistance could take next. When 
the question &#8220;Who&#8217;s willing to get arrested 
today?&#8221; was broached, many raised their hands.</p><p>Two 
days later, in perhaps the most militant participatory action 
of the week, a surprise march of over one hundred people 
bearing torches, drums, anarchist banners, and a two-headed 
effigy of Bush and Kerry took over downtown Raleigh, North 
Carolina, decorating the streets with graffiti and destroying 
bank machines until it reached the state headquarters of 
the Republican Party. The windows of the building were smashed, 
its walls were covered in spraypaint, fireworks were set 
off inside, and the effigy was set afire in the front yard. 
The following day, over fifty-eight major media outlets 
ran a story covering the event, in which the state GOP chief 
of staff was quoted as saying that campaign offices and 
party headquarters were being vandalized throughout the 
nation. &#8220;They have a right to disagree,&#8221; he 
pleaded, &#8220;but to do it agreeably.&#8221;</p><p>The 
following night, yet another spontaneous march occurred 
in Washington, DC, leaving spraypaint in its wake and meeting 
with enthusiasm from locals. From one side of the country 
to the other, by day and by night, militants were carrying 
out actions that demonstrated the seriousness of their discontent 
and invited others to express their own. This was the autonomous 
action model, which had evolved over the preceding year, 
finally being used to effect in circumstances for which 
it was appropriate.</p><p>Ironically, 
as the Inauguration approached in January of 2005, it was 
activists from New York City that insisted protests be organized 
on the mass action model and called for a massive anti-authoritarian 
march, while others called for autonomous actions. This 
time, both were right, and it was only tactical errors, 
not errors in strategy, that prevented the protests from 
shutting down the spectacle. Presidential inaugurations 
provide a rare opportunity for centrally-organized anarchist 
mass actions: they can attract large numbers of anti-authoritarians, 
they offer an obvious target, and the risk of arrests and 
police brutality are forestalled by the presence of diverse 
crowds and media and the desire of the authorities to maintain 
the illusion that everyone is pleased with the ruler being 
sworn in. At this particular inauguration, the ongoing legacy 
of the mass arrests of the People&#8217;s Strike a full 
two and a half years earlier also served to tie the hands 
of the police. At the same time, Washington, DC, being the 
nation&#8217;s capital, provides an excellent field for 
autonomous actions, which could only serve to heighten tensions, 
distract and confuse the police, and emphasize popular discontent.</p><p>The 
massive anarchist march was wisely planned to coincide with 
the other protests of the day, so as to benefit from the 
crowd cover they provided and the divided attention of the 
police. Hundreds of people participated in the march, even 
though, as a result of some strange misunderstanding or 
internal conflict, it left the convergence point early, 
before many would-be participants had even arrived. At the 
previous inauguration, a black bloc had successfully broken 
through one of the checkpoints surrounding the parade route, 
and the organizers planned to repeat this feat and go on 
to block the route. This was the major tactical error that 
prevented the march from being really effective: a basic 
rule of thumb in planning for an action is not to count 
on being able to repeat the past. Had the organizers prepared 
a back-up plan, such as a way to maintain the coherence 
of the bloc if it could not penetrate police lines and a 
secondary target outside the immediate zone of police control, 
it would not have been such a misfortune that the police 
blocked the path of the march before it arrived at a checkpoint. 
As it was, having no backup plan, the march bogged down 
at this point, and broke up; a smaller company of anarchists 
regrouped and succeeded in reaching and charging a checkpoint, 
but lacked the numbers and equipment to break through.</p><p>Other 
problems afflicting the march included an apparent loss 
of contact with the scouting team and poor internal communication 
dynamics that led many to accuse one participating group 
of hijacking the march. Aside from these, the fact that 
the march did not succeed in its professed objective can 
be attributed to the hesitance with which most participants 
approached it, as it was the first militant mass action 
of its size since Miami. There were enough people there 
to break through the police lines, had more of them been 
ready to put their all into it; next time, assured by that 
experience that mass actions are indeed still possible in 
the post-9/11 world, perhaps activists will arrive better 
equipped and more psychologically prepared. Speaking of 
equipment, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that the black 
bloc that broke through the checkpoint in 2000 used an appropriated 
industrial wheelbarrow to spearhead their charge, while 
the march at the 2004 inauguration had only a banner reinforced 
with PVC pipe. PVC pipe is notoriously fragile, and has 
failed militant marches several times now; the beginning 
convergence point was so free from police control that participants 
could have brought in massive wooden shields and other fortifications, 
which would have served much better in the ensuing m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. 
Likewise, the march passed several construction sites that 
less hesitant militants would have raided for materials.</p><p>Just 
when it seemed the day&#8217;s events were over, the crowd 
leaving a packed show by punk band Anti-Flag filled the 
street in a surprise march of hundreds. Bearing torches, 
drums, anarchist banners, spray-paint cans, and shopping 
carts full of useful materials, the throng marched through 
Adams Morgan, an ethnic neighborhood suffering rapid gentrification. 
The results surprised everyone, presumably including those 
who initiated the march. A vast banner reading &#8220;From 
DC to Iraq: With Occupation Comes Resistance&#8221; was 
dropped from the top of a Starbucks coffeeshop, along with 
a great quantity of fireworks. Demonstrators smashed the 
windows of several corporate outlets, including Citibank, 
Riggs Bank, McDonald&#8217;s, and KFC, as well as those 
of a police substation and the windshield of a police car 
following the demonstration; police reports estimated the 
damage to corporate and police property at $15,000. Anarchist 
graffiti covered walls, and many pulled newspaper boxes 
and dumpsters into the streets. Locals who witnessed the 
march were supportive and encouraging to an almost surprising 
degree, honking car horns and cheering; a worker at a local 
Ethiopian restaurant raised his fist and shouted &#8220;Down 
with Bush! We have to shut this city down!&#8221;</p><p>Massive 
numbers of befuddled riot police arrived before the march 
could reach a hotel hosting an Inaugural Ball to which Bush 
had just paid a visit. Most participants dispersed safely; 
approximately seventy were trapped in an alley and arrested, 
but almost all of them were released without charges after 
paying $50. Even factoring in the subsequent backlash from 
those who always oppose confrontational tactics, as militant 
actions go, this was a raging success. It received support 
from unusual quarters, too, including members of Anti-Flag, 
the representative of Iraq Veterans Against the War who 
had spoken at the show, and parents of minors arrested in 
the alley.</p><p>So 
this is where we leave our heroes, escaping from downtown 
Washington, DC in the middle of the night, helicopter spotlights 
flashing overhead and sirens wailing nearby. Is this only 
a momentary anomaly in a world of consolidated state control, 
or a precursor of things to come? Will they manage to find 
common cause with dissidents of other demographics, so a 
real, broad-based insurrection will be possible? How can 
they hone their tactics and strategies to fit the current 
political and social context?</p>
<h3>Conclusion: <br />
When to Act en Masse, How to Act Independently</h3>
<p>From 
the events of the past few years, we can derive some basic 
lessons about both mass and autonomous actions. We had better 
do so&#8212;if we don&#8217;t, the anarchist movement may 
have to go through this learning process all over again.</p><p>First 
of all, let&#8217;s address once and for all the question 
of whether mass actions are still effective in the post-9/11 
era. The answer, in the opinion of everyone involved in 
the development of this analysis, is a resounding yes. The 
examples of the Republican National Convention and the recent 
Presidential Inauguration both indicate that it is still 
possible to act en masse, according to widely disseminated, 
publicly coordinated plans; we have only to be more judicious 
in choosing when and how to do so.</p><p>Without 
at least occasional mass actions, anarchist communities 
risk losing the ability to combine forces, not to mention 
the visibility and influence that are critical to their 
proliferation. At the same time, anarchists must pick the 
mass actions in which they invest themselves carefully; 
every time anarchists call for a mass action, it should 
be a resounding success, so people will feel safe investing 
themselves in participating in the next one.</p><p>What 
elements make for a perfect mass action? First, and most 
obviously, a mass action must be massively attended. The 
model should therefore only be employed when great numbers 
of people can realistically be expected to show. Organizers 
should promote far in advance, and seek to collaborate to 
this end with as wide a range of other groups as possible; 
just as importantly, they should be skilled in reading the 
zeitgeist, so they can pick the right occasions to call 
for mass actions.</p><p>Second, 
a mass action must be attended by a wide range of people, 
and receive a lot of media attention. When diverse crowds 
are present and television cameras are running, police almost 
always hesitate to use extreme force; when they choose to 
do so under those circumstances, it costs them a lot, and 
can even end up being a tactical victory for protesters. 
Organizers must nurture their ability to predict the factors 
that determine police strategy: Will the police want to 
show their control of the situation by making a lot of arrests, 
or will it be more important to them to avoid this and instead 
focus on bluffing and intimidation? What will police be 
expecting, and how will they respond to the unexpected? 
How quickly can they apprehend new information, and how 
concentrated will their attention be?</p><p>Third, 
a mass action should have an objective that is immediately 
comprehensible and attractive, and offer a strategy that 
people can easily adopt for themselves. The demonstrations 
against the Free Trade Area of the Americas summit in Quebec 
City spread from a few hundred militants to the population 
of the entire city because the tactics employed&#8212;masking 
up, throwing back tear gas canisters, blocking roads&#8212;were 
easy to apprehend and apply, and because locals were already 
angry about the police occupying their city. This question 
determines whether a militant engagement ends up as a vanguardist 
group slogging it out in a private war with the government 
or a generalized popular insurrection.</p><p>Fourth, 
militants in a mass action should make sure their plans 
are intelligently coordinated with those of others. As described 
above in the analysis of the protests at the last two Republican 
National Conventions, it is almost always better for dissimilar 
actions to take place simultaneously rather than consecutively. 
In a best case scenario, actions employing different tactics 
can be arranged to complement one another. Healthy relationships 
between activists partial to different tactics facilitate 
this; these require a lot of nurturing between actions, 
and a lot of patience when conflicts arise.</p><p>Finally, 
organizers must take matters such as morale, momentum, and 
crowd dynamics seriously. Under some circumstances, all 
it takes to turn a passive mass into a militant force is 
for a few maniacs to step forward and show what is possible; 
in other cases, an entire militant bloc can be intimidated 
into inactivity by police bluffing. In learning what factors 
enable people to take action, organizers can formulate strategies 
based on realistic expectations.</p><p>In 
planning a mass action, organizers should look back in recent 
history for similar precedents from which they can determine 
what to expect. At the same time, attempting to repeat the 
past&#8212;especially when one&#8217;s enemies have learned 
from it&#8212;is almost always a doomed venture. Organizers 
should consider, instead, the opportunities that have been 
missed before, and try to take advantage of these. When 
employing a strategy for the first time, it is important 
to be prepared for the possibility that it will succeed 
as well as the possibility that it will fail. New strategies 
generally work, and fail only because people lack the assurance 
to follow them through completely; old strategies, on the 
other hand, usually fail because opponents are all too ready 
for them, however ready people are to apply them. Employing 
an old strategy in an entirely new context can be tremendously 
effective; this is something at which the anarchist movement, 
being internationally active and interconnected, should 
excel. Also, both organizers of massive events and individual 
participants in them should formulate backup plans for different 
scenarios, so they can turn any development to their advantage.</p><p>The 
communities in which militant activists develop must share 
basic skills such as how to read a volatile situation, how 
to work in affinity groups, and how and when to disperse. 
Activists of all demographics and backgrounds must be encouraged 
to feel entitled to participate in planning and carrying 
out militant actions. In addition, when conditions are not 
opportune for confrontation, radicals must not pressure 
themselves to do anything rash, but rather save themselves 
for better opportunities.</p><p>During 
the lulls between mass actions, decentralized, autonomous 
actions can serve to keep activists&#8217; skills sharp 
and to continue the struggle on other fronts. As they did 
during the 1990&#8217;s, small-scale local actions can give 
activists the practice they need to be comfortable acting 
in more challenging mass action scenarios; they also connect 
activists to one other, building experienced, dangerous 
groups linked to broader communities. To this purpose, the 
best forms of autonomous action are the ones that, rather 
than striking the most grievous material blows, bring in 
new participants and build solidarity between different 
circles so that militant activity may take place more widely.</p><p>One 
of the most important challenges of the coming years, during 
which we can be sure police repression of all forms of resistance 
will continue and perhaps increase, will be to develop ways 
to act socially and publicly yet with the element of surprise. 
Without this capability, participatory militant action will 
become impossible except once or twice a year at mass actions, 
and it will be impossible to spread militant tactics in 
our local communities. To this end, we have to cultivate 
sites of social interaction and channels of communication 
that are accessible to all but the authorities: these can 
include local communities bonded by potlucks and other face-to-face 
contact, cultural milieus such as politicized music scenes, 
and connections between committed activists and formerly 
apolitical social circles. In these, we can get to know 
and trust one another, and stage assaults on the capitalist 
nightmare from unexpected directions.</p><p>The 
preceding analysis offers three successful prototypes for 
autonomous yet participatory action. The first is the model 
employed by the activists who carried out the G8 solidarity 
action before the Really Really Free Market in Raleigh, 
North Carolina, in which a small, clandestine group acts 
to augment the efforts of an open, accessible group; this 
is perfect for carrying out complicated, high-risk plans, 
but offers little opportunity for new people to be brought 
in and gain experience. The second is the model employed 
by the activists who conceived the protest at the Governor&#8217;s 
Mansion in Maine, in which a core group takes advantage 
of a social setting to invite a larger number of people 
to help plan and participate in an action without revealing 
the most sensitive details of the target; this is a less 
secure, more participatory model, offering roles for those 
not yet sure enough of themselves to organize their own 
major actions, but still limiting participation to an in-group. 
The third is the model employed by the activists who instigated 
the march in Adams Morgan after the Presidential Inauguration 
in Washington, DC, in which a participatory action is initiated 
by a small group within a larger mass; this offers the greatest 
number the opportunity to witness or participate in an action, 
even an extremely confrontational one, but it also can endanger 
participants, especially as collective planning is impossible. 
Hopefully, over the years to come, many more activists will 
make use of and expand on these prototypes, refining and 
combining them in the process.</p><p>It 
may be some time before the next period of intense struggle. 
While it sometimes seemed during the months immediately 
preceding and following the election that the country was 
slipping towards civil war, the atmosphere now is somewhat 
more subdued, as liberals lick their wounds and radicals 
adjust to the post-war, post-election context. This is not 
necessarily a bad thing; the anarchist community is not 
yet ready for an all-out war to the death with the rulers 
of the world. Let&#8217;s make use of this interval to put 
down firmer foundations and develop new skills. When the 
next opportunities arrive to take on the powers that be, 
let&#8217;s be ready, our communities strong and closely 
linked, our courage and confidence in each other tried and 
true.</p>

<div id="footnoteprint">
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>[1] Setting out to shut down a capitalist summit and succeeding 
in doing so may qualify as direct action in the most immediate 
sense, but an anti-capitalist movement that succeeded in 
shutting down summit after summit without bringing any closer 
the abolition of capitalist social relations would be a 
failure, not a success. Hence, such feats ultimately have 
their greatest value as demonstrations of what is possible.</p>
<p>[2] This is not to say that widely publicized but purely symbolic 
actions are sufficient to build a movement that can pose 
a threat to capitalism! To inspire others and attract future 
participants, militant actions must actually strike blows 
and accomplish immediate goals.</p>
<p>[3] This was probably more of an irrational emotional reaction 
than a miscalculation. To the extent that it was a judgment 
call, it indicates that activists overestimated either the 
ability of the government to identify and repress them or 
the threat the government perceived them to pose.</p>
<p> [4] Another notable exception to this generalization occurred 
during an otherwise placid liberal march in Washington, 
DC when a small group of anarchists broke away, marched 
to the World Bank, charged into the building, and trashed 
it from the inside.</p>
<p>[5] Protestors had applied this tactic at the previous FTAA 
ministerial in Quebec City, and met with some success, as 
it was fairly new at the time. By the time of the ministerial 
in Miami, however, fences had been attacked from Genoa to 
Cancun, and it was exactly what the authorities were expecting. 
As a general rule of thumb, it&#8217;s a bad idea to try 
an approach that worked or almost worked in a similar previous 
confrontation, assuming your opponents are in as much of 
a position to learn from the past as you are.</p>
<p>[6] One person or group calling for others to act is little 
better than a vanguard, and can be expected to meet with 
as much success as the various communist splinter groups 
currently do. Calls for decentralized actions work best 
when activists who are already organizing themselves call 
upon others in their networks to join in, offering the opportunity 
to be part of an effort that already has participation and 
momentum in its favor.</p>
<p>[7] Seriously, where do they get this stuff? No anarchists have 
sprayed urine or acid on police officers in the entire recorded 
history of the current anarchist movement, and yet every 
corporate newspaper has dutifully repeated these lies as 
gospel.<a href="#7a">[back]</a> </em></p>
<p>[8] In another hilarious and ironic development, it turned out 
that there was a theater group in New York for the protests 
under the moniker Greene Dragon Society. Scrambling to give 
the impression that they were in control of the situation, 
the FBI announced that it had infiltrated the &#8220;Green 
Dragon Group&#8221; over a year earlier and were abreast 
of all its nefarious plans; this could only be to the misfortune 
of both the aforementioned liberal group and the FBI, however, 
as the Greene Dragon Society doesn&#8217;t appear to have 
been anywhere near the puppet that went up in flames, nor 
to have had anything to do with its construction. A more 
likely story was circulated by Starhawk of the pagan cluster, 
who was engaged in a spiral dance a block away when the 
dragon caught fire; she speculates that it was the energy 
released from their ritual that triggered the conflagration.</p>
<p>[9] Some few anarchists, mostly of the persuasion given to hyper-radical 
rhetoric and little action to back it up, were critical 
of this campaign on the grounds that it was too soft on 
voting. Indeed, insofar as people conflate it with actual 
political participation, voting is extremely pernicious&#8212;as 
every text circulated by the &#8220;Don&#8217;t (Just) Vote&#8221; 
campaign emphasized. That being the case, these critics 
seem to have been raising a new and daring question: entirely 
apart from the dangerous superstitions associated with it, 
can voting itself, taken in a vacuum, be harmful? Your 
humble editor, anxiously concerned about such safety issues, 
has done quite a bit of research on this subject and has 
finally turned up some evidence that this may be the case, 
if only in extreme situations. A dissident account of the 
untimely death of Edgar Allen Poe, advanced most recently 
in the amusing miscellany Why Americans Zigzag When They 
Eat, suggests that the renowned author was killed by being 
voted to death. In those days, political gangs would rig 
elections by shanghaiing vulnerable gentlemen and liquoring 
or doping them up to make them agreeable. On election day, 
these unfortunates would be frog-marched around to all the 
polling stations as fast as possible; once one circuit was 
completed, their handlers would change their clothes, trim 
their mustaches, and run them around again. The faster the 
pace they kept, the more votes they were worth, so it must 
have been a grueling process. (Nowadays, political gangs 
bypass such clumsy methods and accomplish the same thing 
with advertising and voting machine fraud.) Poe was known 
for his stylish dressing, but when he was found&#8212;drunk, 
delirious, and in the process of dying of exhaustion, at 
a Baltimore bar that doubled as a polling station&#8212;he 
was wearing a very cheap suit that didn&#8217;t seem to 
belong to him. It was an election day. So there you have 
it: voting, horror of capitalist horrors, killed the greatest 
horror writer of all time&#8212;and might kill you, too, 
if you put too much stock in it.</p></div>
