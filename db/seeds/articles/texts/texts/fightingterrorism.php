<h1>Fighting Terrorism  Begins at Home</h1>
<h5>How and why 
we used direct action to thwart<br />
a fascist rally, and what 
we learned</h5>
<h6><em>report

<p>Our 
story begins at the polar opposite of liberation and self-determination: 
an utterly apolitical, consumerist macho hardcore show. 
A former bandmate of mine was on tour with a popular band 
in the genre, and I went to see them at the rock club where 
they were opening for another band that had a music video 
on MTV. There were four fights during their set alone.</p>
<p> 
With the exception of the few minutes I got to watch my 
friend making music, I would have felt pretty silly being 
there&#8212;except that, as usual, I had a secret plan. 
Earlier that day, I had learned that the National Socialist 
Movement and the Ku Klux Klan were to hold a &#8220;white 
unity&#8221; rally at the state capital in a couple weeks&#8212;and 
I was interested in whether anyone else felt like this was 
a bad thing. I made an announcement about it before their 
band played, and afterwards collected a list of contacts 
from everyone who was interested in knowing more. Among 
these were, shockingly enough, a group of marines and a 
local part-time police officer; I&#8217;d finally happened 
upon an issue that could bring people together from as disparate 
walks of life as these right wing jarheads and a grizzled, 
willfully unemployed revolutionary anarchist like myself.</p>
<p> 
I also met some old friends there, people I hadn&#8217;t 
seen in a long time. Though they had little experience with 
political activism, they were angry that fascists were going 
to be welcomed into their city, and wanted to do something 
about it. Perfect. We made plans to meet, and passed the 
word along to everyone we trusted.</p>
<p> 
Out of this chance interaction, a planning group formed, 
which held a series of covert meetings in the days leading 
up to the fascist rally. For those who care, our group included 
people of a variety of ethnic groups, genders, sexual orientations, 
and body types; also, just as importantly, it consisted 
of a range of participants from longtime militant activists 
to people who didn&#8217;t consider themselves political 
at all. One of my greatest frustrations with political activism 
as it is sometimes practiced is that in the process of purporting 
to protect against alienating people, activists alienate 
everyone who isn&#8217;t similarly obsessed with radical 
protocol and procedure. This was not the case in our group: 
our discussions were informal, we had no membership list, 
no one needed any prior knowledge of activist culture to 
feel welcome.</p>
<p> 
We decided we were going to do our best to prevent the rally 
from happening at all, or, failing that, to make it as trying 
as possible for the fascists and the city that was hosting 
them. But why, you ask&#8212;don&#8217;t the fascists have 
the right to free speech, just like everybody else? And 
doesn&#8217;t confronting them just make their position 
look more attractive? Before we proceed with the account, 
let&#8217;s go over these questions.</p>
<p> 
First of all, for an anarchist like me, the question of 
&#8220;the right to free speech&#8221; is a moot point. 
Talk of &#8220;rights&#8221; only makes sense if you accept 
the existence of an all-powerful state which grants them 
and can take them away. If you don&#8217;t believe in recognizing 
the authority of a governing power that holds all our &#8220;rights&#8221; 
hostage, but instead believe that social life has to be 
cooperatively determined by those in the thick of it, the 
question is not whether someone has the &#8220;right&#8221; 
to do something, but whether or not what they&#8217;re doing 
is a good, socially responsible thing. The government might 
grant a corporation the &#8220;right&#8221; to destroy a 
forest or evict people from their homes, but that wouldn&#8217;t 
make it right for us to stand idly by while they did so. 
The idea that any government can dole out rights impartially 
is a fallacy, anyway; as those in power inevitably use that 
power to represent their own interests, we might as well 
use whatever power we have to represent ours. Besides, the 
moment the Nazis and the Klan have the chance, they&#8217;ll 
be thrilled to prevent people like you and me from exercising 
any so-called rights at all. Protecting their right to organize 
towards depriving others of rights, on the grounds that 
it&#8217;s necessary to maintain the system of rights, is 
naive at best, if not outright duplicitous.</p>
<p> 
As for the &#8220;just ignore them and they&#8217;ll go 
away&#8221; school of thought, that didn&#8217;t work in 
Italy, Germany, or Spain a few generations back, and it 
hasn&#8217;t worked lately in Europe either, where a powerful 
new fascist movement has been gaining a foothold. These 
fascist groups, once allowed to recruit members and get 
active, quickly begin targeting immigrants, radicals, and 
others with violence; the only solution that has worked 
is for activists to block their attempts to organize from 
the very beginning. In fact, scarcely two and a half decades 
earlier, a similar rally held by the same organizations 
in a city only an hour away from this one had ended in the 
murders of anti-fascist protesters, for which the police 
never found anyone guilty even though it was obvious who 
had committed them. Our reluctance to let this rally go 
unchallenged did not proceed from idle concerns.</p>
<p> 
Aside from the fascists themselves, we also had a bone to 
pick with the city. If they had not offered police protection, 
the fascists surely would not have dared show up to preach 
their hate and violence, for fear of a taste of their own 
medicine. As it turned out, the city must have spent tens 
of thousands of dollars&#8212;at the least&#8212;to make 
this rally possible. I know from plenty of experience at 
demonstrations that cities usually only spend that kind 
of money to prevent free speech. Having had some of my own 
attempts to exercise my &#8220;right to free speech&#8221; 
end in tear gas and rubber bullet attacks (which are not 
cheap!), I found it particularly insulting that the government 
saw fit to allocate so much tax-payer money to enable the 
fascists to recruit right on their front lawn. Couldn&#8217;t 
that money have been better spent on education programs 
or social security, if it had to be spent at all?</p>
<p> 
What could be in it for them? Could it be that the conservatives 
in power were glad to offer the public the spectacle of 
these extreme groups, in comparison with whom they would 
appear moderate? Regardless, we decided it would be our 
job to make sure they had to work to earn every dollar they 
spent on security, and to cost them more than they&#8217;d 
bargained for if possible. This would discourage them from 
providing protection for future fascist rallies: if they 
knew the price tag would be even steeper than it had been 
this time, they might just tell the Klan and Nazis they&#8217;d 
have to go it alone, which would be fair enough. It would 
also highlight the willingness of the city to go to such 
great lengths to protect the fascists, which itself deserved 
public scrutiny. And in the course of our own efforts, we 
hoped to open a space for others to protest the rally as 
well, in whatever ways they saw fit.</p>
<p> 
When you engage in confrontational action, there&#8217;s 
always the possibility you will step on a few toes in the 
process. There&#8217;s a certain kind of activist organizer 
who gets really offended if everyone doesn&#8217;t follow 
the guidelines his group has unilaterally set; in addition 
to that, though I&#8217;m not one to believe in the myth 
that the masses are so &#8220;moderate&#8221; that any kind 
of militant action alienates them, it can in fact happen 
that people are intimidated by a masked group whose goals 
and tactics aren&#8217;t clear to them. We discussed the 
fact that we would be running this risk, and decided that 
in this case it was worth it: our first priority was not 
to convert people to our perspective, but to stop the fascists 
from getting a foothold for theirs. If we did make a bad 
impression on any other protesters, that wasn&#8217;t going 
to turn them into fascists; and if everyone associated fascists 
with chaos and trouble, so much the better. I can imagine 
the Nazi &#8220;Commander&#8221; in city hall trying to 
get a permit next time, and the functionary explaining: 
&#8220;No, last time y&#8217;all came here you brought your 
friends the anarchists, and it was a big mess.&#8221;</p>
<p> 
Finally, apart from discouraging the fascists and unmasking 
the city&#8217;s allegiances, this was a great opportunity 
for us proponents of direct action to put our experience 
at the service of other rightfully angry people, and get 
to know each other better in the bargain. As it turned out, 
by the time the event was over we&#8217;d made a lot more 
new friends than the Klan or the N.S.M. had.</p>
<p> 
Publicly, we took advantage of a few more social events 
to announce that counter-rally actions of some kind would 
take place, and used the lists thus gathered to send out 
reminders; we also wheatpasted fliers and posted notices 
on the internet to the same effect. Privately, we worked 
on strategy and structure. Those of us whose friends had 
been involved in some of the better-known anti-fascist actions 
of the preceding years contacted them and asked for pointers. 
Some of us explored the area and made annotated maps, which 
were distributed at meetings. We gathered what materials 
we could, and brainstormed about what approaches to take. 
We did our best to spread word of our plans to everyone 
who might want to participate, adding specifics according 
to the degree to which we felt we could trust them, so as 
to prevent information from falling into the wrong hands.</p>
<p> 
Shortly thereafter, we learned that a permitted protest 
had also been scheduled. Some of us had mixed feelings about 
this. It meant, on the one hand, that there would be a safe 
zone for protesters who didn&#8217;t want to risk police 
repression; on the other hand, in our experience in this 
city, whenever a permitted protest occurred it was some 
distance from the event being protested, surrounded by a 
thick line of police and metal fencing, and proved to be 
a disempowering experience for all who participated in it. 
As all areas except the permitted zone would be locked down 
by police, it was likely that the permitted protest would 
absorb all who showed up and the tone of the day would thus 
be set by the few who had organized it&#8212;which would 
mean all the energy we had put into our organizing was absorbed 
by their project, an outcome that would disappoint those 
who had accepted our invitation to the event in hopes of 
effectively contesting the fascist rally. To top it all 
off, organizers of permitted protests sometimes take offense 
to any other form of protest organized to take place alongside, 
so we had to be careful not to create dissension just by 
virtue of acting on our own initiative.</p>
<p> 
We concluded that we had to find a point at which to confront 
the fascists that was far from the permitted protest, both 
for civility&#8217;s sake and to make sure no one was at 
risk who did not choose to be. Fortunately, our research 
had revealed that they would be using a parking lot on the 
opposite side of the rally site from the permitted zone. 
Those of us who were prepared for potentially dangerous 
physical confrontation planned to form a group that would 
advance on the parking lot. There were residential neighborhoods 
nearby, which we hoped would be far enough outside the zone 
of police surveillance that we could gather there and approach 
with the element of surprise. Once in m&ecirc;l&eacute;e 
with the police and perhaps the fascists, this group would 
stick tightly together, and do everything possible to thwart 
arrests. As the police had no knowledge of our plans, we 
didn&#8217;t expect they would be prepared to make mass 
arrests, so we figured our primary problem was to stop them 
from picking off individuals. If we were beset by serious 
police attacks, we would retreat into the residential neighborhood, 
maintaining our coherence on the way, and then disperse 
there where the greatest number of us would be able to escape. 
If all else failed, we decided we would break up into our 
affinity groups and act individually to cause disruptions. 
If we could create an unstable enough situation by any of 
these means, we expected the rally would be delayed or canceled.</p>
<p> 
A strategy alone is never enough. As things never go as 
expected, it is critical to have a structure that can remain 
useful when circumstances change. We divided into affinity 
groups, and buddied up inside of those; also, several individuals 
who were hoping to be noncombatants formed a communications 
team. Each of them was equipped with a cell phone or two-way 
radio, and chose an area to patrol or a task to fulfill&#8212;taking 
down license plate numbers from the fascists&#8217; cars, 
for example, or keeping abreast of areas free of police 
surveillance to which people could retreat if need be. They 
arranged an internal network so that information could be 
circulated as swiftly as possible and passed on to one of 
two contacts in the action-oriented group. During the event, 
they not only monitored the movements of fascists and police, 
but also distributed information to all of us when we were 
spread out.</p>
<p> 
The night before the rally, some brave souls went out with 
spray-paint, dressed as civilians. This was a role that 
could be played by those of us who felt more comfortable 
acting alone than in the chaos of a big demonstration, and 
an important one. By morning, the political district of 
the city, especially the aforementioned parking lot and 
the actual site of the rally, was covered thickly in anti-fascist 
graffiti. No matter that the city, clearly hell-bent on 
their chosen project of being welcoming hosts to the fascists, 
went to the surprising trouble of sandblasting all the graffiti 
off by the time the rally was to begin; they were our primary 
target readership, and now they have one more serious expense 
to factor into their budget next time they consider welcoming 
fascists.</p>
<p> 
Just before dawn, others went to a hiding place that had 
been scouted earlier and stashed our secret weapons: several 
4&#8217; by 8&#8217; plywood banners painted with anti-fascist 
slogans. These had hand-holds cut into them (though after 
one of us had his hand smashed by a police baton while holding 
one up, we decided back handles would have been better), 
and could be tied together at the ends to form a massive, 
jointed, mobile barricade. Carrying these around our group 
would make it difficult for police to snatch or beat us, 
or for that matter easily identify us or gauge our numbers. 
They were also festive, and made our goals clear. In the 
future, we&#8217;ll probably use plexiglass instead of plywood, 
since one of them finally snapped in half after too much 
pressure from police on one side and protesters on the other&#8212;but 
we&#8217;ll get to that story shortly.</p>
<p> 
We held a final meeting the morning of the big day, to fill 
in those who hadn&#8217;t been present at earlier ones and 
make some last minute decisions. We picked a convergence 
point out in the residential neighborhood, and a time we 
hoped would be just long enough before the fascists would 
cross from the parking lot to the rally site that we could 
stop them, but not so far in advance that the police could 
force us to disperse first, or that too few potential participants 
in our action would have arrived (since, unfortunately, 
those promoting the permitted event had announced the protest 
as starting at the same time as the rally, which would be 
too late to interfere with it). Until that moment, we would 
be scattered into couples and tiny groups, in hopes of avoiding 
premature police attention. Our scouts would inform those 
of us with communications equipment if anything unexpected 
developed&#8212;say, the fascists were heading to the rally 
site earlier than expected, or there was already a police 
presence at the site of our planned convergence&#8212;and 
these spokespeople would pass word around to others, so 
we could react quickly.</p>
<p> 
We arrived a couple hours before the rally was to begin 
to find the entire area swarming with police in and out 
of uniform, massive metal fencing surrounding the rally 
site, surveillance cameras set up, snipers on the rooftops, 
mobile command centers down the block, several officers 
on horseback and more in riot gear, and even a helicopter 
overhead. It was intimidating, and there was little sign 
of other protesters. Our scouts reported that fascists had 
already arrived, and were fraternizing with police officers 
in a couple areas; however, there didn&#8217;t seem to be 
much chance of catching them alone, so we stuck with plan 
A.</p>
<p> 
We were all dressed as nondescript civilians, but carried 
bandannas and sweatshirts with which to render ourselves 
anonymous. Walking around the vicinity, we met people we 
recognized from other demonstrations and shows, and passed 
on to those we trusted the time and location of our convergence 
point&#8212;and maps, for those who had come from out of 
town. When the time came, we all made our way to the designated 
area, doing our best to appear to be nothing more than small 
groups moving randomly, and hoping not to hear the familiar 
thunder of helicopters overhead.</p>
<p> 
The moment was upon us&#8212;we pulled up our masks, grabbed 
the banners, and tied them together as we formed our bloc 
and made swiftly for the parking lot. There were perhaps 
forty of us, and we were going to take on at least one hundred 
fifty police, not to mention the thirty-odd fascists that 
had occasioned all this trouble. One of us had a great bass 
drum, with which to maintain morale&#8212;morale is critical 
in such situations, it makes all the difference in what 
a group feels capable of doing. Others had emergency whistles, 
which make a loud noise while leaving the hands free (though 
you should be careful not to damage your hearing with them, 
if playing for a long time). Later in the day, the drums 
turned out to be extremely useful for centering our group 
when it was spread out, and directing motion en masse. More 
drums and drummers might have been even more effective at 
these purposes, and at least would have saved our drummer 
the welts sustained from having to play constantly.</p>
<p> 
In a couple minutes we were across the street from the parking 
lot, jogging with our banners around us. At this instant, 
remarkably, we had the element of surprise on our side: 
neither the police nor the fascists were expecting us, we 
were throwing them into an unexpected situation and thus 
off-balance; the initiative was ours. For the rest of the 
day, we were not able to recapture this advantage; much 
of what we accomplished proceeded from the moment when we 
had it. Arguably, the mistake we made at this juncture was 
not to cross the street to the parking lot before the police 
reached us. In discussions after the action, it came out 
that those who had thought to shout out that it was time 
to move across the street held back for fear that there 
might be undercover police among us who would identify them 
as leaders. In retrospect, we probably had enough coherence 
as a group that we could have prevented police from snatching 
supposed leaders; but the real solution to such a problem 
is to have the feeling of entitlement to make recommendations 
more evenly distributed among participants. This happened 
as the day wore on and all of us developed more confidence; 
unfortunately, police preparations increased at the same 
pace our morale did. Strike all at once and go for it while 
you have the chance, that&#8217;s the moral of the story.</p>
<p> 
Be that as it may, in the next instant a line of police 
charged forward and met us in the middle of the street as 
we headed for the parking lot. A struggle followed, with 
them pushing on the banners from one side, and us from the 
other. A couple of us were struck or dragged by the hair 
at this point; it&#8217;s worth pointing out, though this 
is no surprise, that the police were in fact the ones who 
initiated violence that day. All those they tried to grab 
for arrests were pulled back by friends. Partly owing to 
the general lack of experience in our numbers, at this point 
we had not yet developed a strong sense of what we could 
accomplish, so many were not as ready to push the limits 
as they would be later after they&#8217;d gotten accustomed 
to the situation. Consequently, we were pushed back across 
the street; but we held our ground there, seizing the corner 
of the intersection between the parking lot and the rally 
site and holding it in the face of further police pressure.</p>
<p> 
A standoff ensued. We stood on the corner, banners up on 
the outside, with a line of police in front of us and more 
police massing behind them. The fascists in the parking 
lot were hiding behind a dumpster, totally out of view and 
out of range of projectiles. Over the next few minutes, 
our numbers swiftly swelled, as protesters from a variety 
of perspectives and walks of life came to join us. In fact, 
in taking this corner, we had opened up a vast space around 
the rally site for those protesters who didn&#8217;t want 
to remain in the permitted zone, and scores rapidly filled 
it. This was definitely one of our accomplishments for the 
day, that we made it possible for protesters to move around 
the area at will, exercising their freedom of speech beyond 
the restrictions of the police cordon.</p>
<p> 
We had failed to actually meet the fascists in conflict, 
but now, having demonstrated our readiness for confrontation, 
we were between them and their rally site, and it was clear 
to everyone that there would be trouble if they came within 
range. They remained hidden behind their dumpster, with 
the police around them for protection, and other police 
conferred on how to handle the situation, while still others 
reinforced the line facing us. This went on for perhaps 
fifteen minutes, until it was time for their rally to begin. 
It continued for another fifteen minutes, and then another, 
and then another, until we had succeeded in delaying their 
rally by a full forty five minutes&#8212;no small achievement, 
under the circumstances! By this time, our group was dispersed 
within the much larger group of protesters that had gathered 
at the corner, most clearly understanding that they were 
delaying the rally by amassing there. Many were shouting 
furiously at the police for being willing to defend such 
opponents of liberty. The atmosphere was heated, to say 
the least.</p>
<p> 
It&#8217;s worth interrupting here to emphasize what a different 
feeling it is to act for yourself with your companions in 
a situation like this than it is simply to follow the dictates 
of the police or some other authority. As frightening as 
it was to struggle physically with armed police officers, 
it was even more exhilarating to feel that we were acting 
according to our consciences rather than out of fear or 
conformity. That sensation, the feeling that your life really 
is your own and anything is possible, that you experience 
when you come to see the world around you as something negotiable 
and engage with it deliberately, is one I wish everyone 
could taste.</p>
<p> 
In acting as a small, self-starting group, we had opened 
up the option of militant resistance to many others, who 
joined in enthusiastically; but the downside to this was 
that our group lost coherence within the larger mass. Our 
banners and banner holders had been separated from one another 
in the chaos, and we never again that day formed a tight 
nucleus. A city bus protected by police finally showed up 
to collect the cowering fascists, and drove off in the opposite 
direction with them inside. We received reports from our 
scouts that it was headed to the opposite side of the rally 
site, on the far side of the permitted zone from where we 
were; we tried to move down towards it, but moving in any 
even minimally organized manner through the assembled masses 
around the narrow perimeter of the rally site proved impossible. 
We didn&#8217;t want to move through the permitted zone 
itself, anyway, so as not to draw heat to those seeking 
safety there or interfere with their chosen form of protest. 
This was the point at which individual actions by scattered 
groups could have taken place to heighten the atmosphere 
of uncertainty; whether any did is unknown, but certainly 
not enough did. Best case scenario, we would have had others 
ready to intercept the bus, but we had not prepared enough 
for that.</p>
<p> 
Surrounded by police, with us still hundreds of feet away, 
the fascists were able to leave the bus without being assaulted 
by anything more than the jeers of bystanders. Realizing 
that we had at last failed to prevent them from reaching 
the site, we changed our strategy: at this point our only 
hope of stopping the rally was to create chaos that seemed 
uncontrollable, so we attempted a full frontal offensive. 
The police barring our path had been replaced by now with 
officers in full body armor, and officers with tear gas 
rifles and on horseback stood behind them. The great metal 
fence was between us and them; it was composed of massively 
heavy sections, almost inextricably linked together. Amazingly, 
we were able to get one of the sections free, and pushed 
forward with it and a couple of our own barricades against 
the lines of police that immediately rushed to meet us. 
This confrontation was much more pitched than the earlier 
one had been; the police rained blows upon us, and we struck 
back, lifting the visors of their helmets to even the odds 
where necessary. One particularly aggressive officer lost 
his head in the fray and found himself surrounded by us&#8212;his 
colleagues had to snatch him over the fence to safety. It 
was real pandemonium at times, when police and protesters 
were mixed up and the lines between them became unclear; 
I believe at one point I even saw a demonstrator make use 
of a stage diving technique to get into the action! Once 
again, those the police attempted to nab for arrests were 
freed, but we failed to make much headway against their 
lines. In the end, we lifted the section of metal fencing 
over our heads and passed it to the back of the crowd, where 
it was dropped into a pit at the foot of the building behind 
us so it would not block further advances on our part. This 
simple disposal of a large segment of the police barricade 
was gratifying, at least, but it was clear we weren&#8217;t 
prepared to break through their lines frontally.</p>
<p> 
The fascist rally was in full swing, now, with the two dozen 
of them who had made it out of the parking lot holding their 
swastika flags and making their speeches, most of which 
were drowned out by audience noise. The police had prohibited 
even the few fascist sympathizers who had showed up from 
passing through their lines, perhaps as a result of our 
activities; it was only fascist would-be leaders, their 
children, and the cameras of the mainstream media on the 
site. Lacking other ideas as to how to interrupt the event, 
some who had brought smoke bombs attempted to deploy one. 
The plywood banners that were still in our possession proved 
useful here; by holding them at waist height, up in the 
air, some were able to obscure the vision of the police 
ahead of us (though perhaps not of the rooftop snipers with 
binoculars) while others attempted to light and throw the 
smoke bomb. Under the circumstances this was imprudent at 
best, though, since at that point there were many around 
us who were not prepared for this level of risk. Some of 
us, not sure how we felt about what was going on, took it 
upon ourselves to form a buffer between the ones with the 
smoke bomb and everyone else. The inexperienced individual 
who attempted to hurl the smoke bomb once it was lit failed 
to get it past the banners, and it was something of a debacle, 
though no one was hurt (or scared, with the possible exception 
of said individual). Moral of the story: as my friend&#8217;s 
high school band teacher always told him, practice at home!</p>
<p> 
Others among us took advantage of the sympathetic crowd 
cover to paint the buildings behind us with small slogans 
and artwork critical of fascism. Conversations took place, 
as well: people asked why we were wearing masks, and were 
generally understanding when we explained it was to avoid 
being profiled by the police&#8212;and, for that matter, 
the fascists, who were running surveillance of demonstrators 
for their own purposes.</p>
<p> 
Perhaps the only decidedly negative receptions any of us 
experienced came from two of the organizers of the permitted 
rally. One of them, a white man associated with the flagship 
state university, had come up to us when we were engaged 
in our standoff between the parking lot and the rally site, 
suggesting that we cease our militant activity and join 
the silent, passive protest in the permitted zone; he persisted 
in insisting, providing no tactical rationale for why we 
should give up the gains we had made at that point, until 
one hotheaded young person finally asked if he was a police 
officer. The other, somewhat less absurdly, asked the demonstrator 
with the big drum to stop playing it in the proximity of 
the permitted zone, on the grounds that it was drowning 
out their silent protest; for a time, the drummer was silent, 
out of respect for her request. Some tempers did flare in 
the midst of the fray, it&#8217;s true, and it is possible 
that others exchanged harsh words at some point during the 
day. It&#8217;s very important that those of us who practice 
direct action demonstrate the utmost in civility and sensitivity 
in the process of doing so, so there will never be any question 
about what part of our hearts such actions proceed from, 
or whether direct action activists are generally welcoming 
and responsible people.</p>
<p> 
Well, back to the action. At this point, certain that we 
were not going to succeed in actually shutting down the 
rally, many of us made our way back up the perimeter towards 
the parking lot, to enact plan B: go after their cars. At 
the corner we had occupied before, we were met once again 
with a line of police, and there was another skirmish, this 
time involving mounted police as well. There were some blows 
and angry words exchanged between police officers and protesters&#8212;the 
latter now including a broad diversity of individuals, not 
just the organized demographic that had initiated direct 
action at the beginning of the event. Yet again, those the 
police grabbed were pulled free, but our progress was blocked. 
All the same, some individuals, moving stealthily outside 
the mass, subsequently managed to circumvent the police 
line and infiltrate the parking lot. The tires of a vehicle 
belonging to a fascist skinhead were slashed, and some scuffling 
and chasing ensued. The individuals involved managed to 
get away, but the rest of us on the corner could have done 
better to support them by making another charge at the police 
line around this time to create a distraction.</p>
<p> 
It was shortly afterwards that the day&#8217;s five arrests 
took place; all five of them were the result of individuals 
walking around apart from the masked bloc while still wearing 
their masks. This made them obvious targets for police. 
Clearly, we should have gone over that lesson more thoroughly 
beforehand: wear your mask with the others in masks who 
can protect you, change your appearance radically when you 
leave their company. One individual&#8217;s collarbone was 
broken in the process of the arrest, thanks to a policeman&#8217;s 
overzealous tackling. All those arrested were bailed out 
of jail by that night; an experienced civil rights lawyer 
volunteered to take their cases gratis, and is currently 
in the process of getting them through the legal system 
with a minimum of hassles and repercussions.<br>
Realizing that our morale was waning, our numbers dwindling, 
and the most dangerous period of the day approaching&#8212;when 
the permitted protesters would disperse, leaving only us 
and the police&#8212;we decided against attempting to assail 
the fascists as they were returned to the parking lot. It 
was time to quit while we were as ahead as we were going 
to get, before any more arrests could be made. Those of 
us in masks and sweatshirts melted into the larger crowd, 
swiftly changing our clothing outside the view of the police, 
and then made our way in ones and twos out of the area as 
protesters from the permitted protest did the same. We suffered 
no more arrests in this process; we had successfully delayed 
the state-subsidized fascist rally, decorated the walls 
of the state political district with politics of our own, 
fought over a hundred fifty thoroughly equipped riot police, 
and lived to tell the tale.</p>
<p> 
Most mainstream media coverage of the event was deceitful, 
to say the least. They drastically underestimated the number 
of protesters, misrepresented the atmosphere by describing 
people as practically being amenable to the fascist presence, 
and made little to no mention of the way we delayed the 
rally or the violence with which the police responded. The 
fact that the mainstream cameras and reporters were the 
only ones allowed inside the police lines with the fascists 
was as telling as the spectacle many of us witnessed of 
the police chief and the fascist top dog smiling and laughing 
and chatting together behind the police lines.</p>
<p> 
Underground and independent media coverage was much more 
thorough and honest. Predictably, there was a post on a 
website from the white guy from the university mentioned 
above, arguing that although he understood the value of 
diversity of tactics, this demonstration had not been the 
appropriate time for direct action. Such a statement is 
disingenuous; accepting diversity of tactics means recognizing 
and respecting that others are going to make their own decisions 
about tactics and act accordingly, not granting that diverse 
approaches are acceptable &#8220;when I say so&#8221;! He 
argued, essentially, that the most proper role of any counter-rally 
demonstration was to involve the greatest possible number 
of people, especially those most seriously affected by fascist 
organizing&#8212;presumably assuming that non-confrontational 
tactics are always the most popular, and that people of 
color are the ones chiefly at risk from fascist organizing 
(when, in fact, people of anarchist and queer orientations, 
not to mention Jewish heritage, all of whom were present 
in our number along with people of color, are also significantly 
at risk from fascist activity). I would argue to the contrary 
that there were at least one hundred people at the protest 
that day, if not more, who went explicitly to confront the 
fascists and their protectors, and who wouldn&#8217;t have 
been there otherwise&#8212;that is to say, the best way 
to involve the greatest number of people is for the broadest 
possible array of approaches to be applied without interfering 
with one another. For the most part, we took great care 
to keep well away from the area reserved for the permitted 
rally, and did a decent job of not hindering their chosen 
approach. With the exception of this individual, and a clown 
(yes, literally, a clown) the mainstream media found to 
say that it was unfair that our noise was drowning out the 
fascists&#8217; articulation of their ideas, few others 
expressed disapproval of the way our actions interacted 
with those of other protesters.</p>
<p> 
After the smoke cleared, we met again to discuss what had 
worked and what could have worked better. Spirits were generally 
high. We had demonstrated the power of a few individuals 
to come up with an idea, deploy it in the face of incredible 
odds, and influence the course of events. Acting on our 
own initiative, exploring our potential in practice, we 
had taken on the assembled powers of the Ku Klux Klan, the 
National Socialist Movement, and the state government, and 
scored some significant victories. Our initial plan for 
converging and setting the tone for the day&#8217;s had 
worked, and had we had a little more experience, numbers, 
or morale, we might well have shut the event down entirely. 
Beyond this, we had all gotten to know one another much 
better, and learned a lot about the amazing things we could 
do together.</p>
<p> 
Most of the necessary constructive criticism has been covered 
above, but one point remains to be made. It&#8217;s important 
that individuals participating in direct actions not go 
any farther than they feel confident and comfortable doing; 
if you get hurt or arrested or otherwise in trouble while 
participating in a level of engagement for which you are 
not emotionally prepared, the effects can be debilitating. 
Far better that you get started slowly and conservatively, 
building a sustainable involvement with direct action projects 
that can continue over a lifetime, than rush into an action 
with wild abandon, have a bad experience, and swear off 
further participation in such actions. All but one of us 
had a really empowering, fulfilling time preparing for and 
engaging in this protest, and the one who came away from 
it with a sour taste did so in part because he had not prepared 
himself for the possible consequences of the lengths to 
which he took his resistance that day. Let&#8217;s fight, 
let&#8217;s run risks and push limits, but let&#8217;s do 
so consciously and carefully, as part of a long-term process, 
so the experiences we gain in so doing will not go to waste!</p>
