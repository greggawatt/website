<h1>There is a Secret World  Concealed Within this One.</h1>
<h5>The lives we lead, and the lives we wish we led.</h5>
<p>
This world, the so-called &#147;real world,&#148; is just a front. Pull 
back the curtain and you&#146;ll see the libraries are all filled with 
runaways writing novels, the highways are humming with escapees and sympathizers, 
all the receptionists and sensible mothers are straining at the leash 
for a chance to show how alive they still are. . . and all that talk of 
practicality and responsibility is just threats and bluffing to keep us 
from reaching out our hands to find that heaven lies in reach before us.</p>
<p> You can taste it in the shock and roar of a first, unexpected kiss, 
or in the blood in your mouth that instant after an accident when you 
realize you&#146;re still alive. It blows in the wind you feel on the 
rooftops of a really reckless night of adventure. You hear it in the magic 
of your favorite songs, how they lift and transport you in ways that no 
science or psychology could ever account for. It might be you&#146;ve 
seen evidence of it scratched into bathroom walls in a code without a 
key, or you&#146;ve been able to make out a pale reflection of it in the 
movies they make to keep us entertained. It&#146;s in between the words 
when we speak of our desires and aspirations, still lurking somewhere 
beneath the limitations of being &#147;practical&#148; and &#147;realistic.&#148;</p><p>
When poets and radicals stay up until sunrise, wracking their brains for 
the perfect sequence of words or deeds to fill hearts (or cities) with 
fire, they&#146;re trying to find a hidden entrance to it. When children 
escape out the window to go wandering late at night, or freedom fighters 
search for a weakness in government fortifications, they&#146;re trying 
to sneak into it&#151;for they know better than us where the doors are 
hidden. When teenagers vandalize a billboard to provoke all-night chases 
with the police, or anarchists interrupt an orderly demonstration to smash 
the windows of a corporate chain store, they&#146;re trying to storm its 
gates. </p><p>
When you&#146;re making love and you discover a new sensation or region 
of your lover&#146;s body, and the two of you feel like explorers discovering 
a new part of the world on a par with a desert oasis or the coast of an 
unknown continent, as if you are the first ones to reach the north pole 
or the moon, you are charting its frontiers.</p><p>
It&#146;s not a safer place than this one&#151;on the contrary, it is 
the sensation of danger there that brings us back to life: the feeling 
that for once, for one moment that seems to eclipse the past and future, 
there is something real at stake.</p><p>
Maybe you stumbled into it by accident, once, amazed at what you found. 
The old world splintered behind and inside you, and no physician or metaphysician 
could put it back together again. Everything before became trivial, irrelevant, 
ridiculous as the horizons suddenly telescoped out around you and undreamt-of 
new paths offered themselves. And perhaps you swore that you would never 
return, that you would live out the rest of your life electrified by that 
urgency, in the thrill of discovery and transformation&#151;but return 
you did.</p><p>
Common sense dictates that this world can only be experienced temporarily, 
that it is just the shock of transition, and no more; but the myths we 
share around our fires tell a different story: we hear of women and men 
who stayed there for weeks, years, who never returned, who lived and died 
there as heroes. We know, because we feel it in that atavistic chamber 
of our hearts that holds the memory of freedom from a time before time, 
that this secret world is near, waiting for us. You can see it in the 
flash in our eyes, in the abandon of our dances and love affairs, in the 
protest or party that gets out of hand.</p>
<p> You&#146;re not the only one trying to find it. We&#146;re out here, 
too . . . some of us are even waiting there for you. And you should know 
that anything you&#146;ve ever done or considered doing to get there is 
not crazy, but beautiful, noble, necessary.</p>
<p>
Revolution is simply the idea we could enter that secret world and never 
return; or, better, that we could burn away this one, to reveal the one 
beneath entirely.</p>
