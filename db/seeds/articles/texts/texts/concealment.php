<h1>The Concealment Of Death</h1>
<p> Here's an exercise to try at home. You will need a working stopwatch, 
or another timepiece that measures seconds. Before you begin, seat yourself 
in a comfortable chair and loosen your clothing. </p>
<p> Watch the second hand as it passes around the face of the clock. Picture 
the moment of your death, perhaps many decades in the future, or perhaps 
only a few years or months (who can know?). Wait for the second hand to 
reach the starting point at the top of the clockface, and then watch as 
it records the passing of one minute of your life. Now imagine the clock 
counting down the minutes of your life to the moment of your death. Try 
this exercise picturing this moment a few decades in the future, then 
repeat it picturing the moment next year. Repeat it picturing the moment 
of your death next month. Next week. Tonight. After all, you never know. 
</p>
<p> Now observe the minute and hour hands on the clock. What were you doing 
at this time twenty four hours ago? Forty eight hours ago? One month ago? 
What will you be doing at this time in a week? </p>
<p> Imagine that the moment of your death is one month away. Consider--if 
you knew that this was true, what would you be doing right now? What would 
you be doing at this time tomorrow? Repeat this step, imagining your death 
to be one year away. Does this make very much difference in your thoughts 
about what you would do today and tomorrow if you knew the date of your 
death? </p>
<p> Compare your activities over the last twenty four hours to the activities 
you would have chosen if you had known that you would leave this world 
in one month or one year. Compare your activities over the last month, 
the last year, the last decade to those you would have chosen if you had 
known that on this day you would have only thirty days or twelve months 
left to live. How different would your life have been if you had known 
the date of your approaching death? Would you be ready to die in a month 
or a year, having lived the life that you have? </p>
<p> Chances are, at least as far as we all know, that most of the people 
who read this text and participate in this exercise will live for many 
more years or even decades afterwards. But still, look at the second hand 
of the stopwatch, and follow it as it records the passing minutes, counting 
down the minutes of your life that remain to you as they slip away. Are 
you living the life that you want to live? Are you living a life that, 
at any given moment, you could look back upon with satisfaction if you 
suddenly realized that it was about to end? Are you living the sort of 
life that you would wish upon a human being, a life that is exciting and 
full, a life that is well spent, every minute of it? If the answer is 
no, what can you do in the time that still remains to you--however long 
or short that may be--to make your life more like the life you would like 
to live? For we all do have only a limited amount of time granted to us 
in this world--and so we should use it with this in mind. </p>
<p> If you find, looking back upon your life, that you have spent years 
living without any consideration of your mortality, this is really not 
unusual. For our social/cultural environment does not encourage us to 
think much about the limits that nature places on our lives. Death and 
aging are denied and hidden away as if they were shameful and embarrassing. 
The older members of our society are hidden away in "retirement homes" 
like lepers in leper colonies. The billboards, magazine photos, and television 
commercials that meet our eyes at every turn show only images of healthy 
men and women in the prime of their life. Cemeteries, which once memorialized 
the dead and preserved a place for them in the thoughts of the living, 
are now forgotten in abandoned neighborhoods and overgrown with weeds. 
When a man dies, the rituals which once would have celebrated his life 
and brought the subject of human mortality to the thoughts of those who 
survived him are now often regarded as mere inconveniences. Death is impolite 
and embarrassing, it is considered bad etiquette, for there is no place 
for it in today's busy world of corporate mergers and record-breaking 
conspicuous consumption. Our busy schedules and glossy magazines neither 
make allowance for it nor offer any explanation of how it might be relevant 
to our value system or our lives. </p>
<p>And indeed if we were to stop and ponder the subject, perhaps we would 
find that when we seriously consider the limits of our time on this planet, 
keeping up with television comedies and having a good rsum seem less important 
than they did before. Our cultural silence about human mortality allows 
us to forget how much weight the individual moments of our lives carry, 
adding up as they do to our lives themselves. Thus we may squander countless 
hours watching television or balancing checkbooks--hours that in retrospect 
we might have done better to have spent walking on the sea shore with 
our loved ones, cooking gourmet meals for our children or friends, writing 
fiction, or hitchhiking across South America. The reality of our future 
death is not easy for any of us to come to terms with, but it is surely 
better that we consider this now than regret not doing so later when it 
is too late. </p>
<p>Our modern denial of death has a deeper significance, beyond its functions 
as a reaction to our fear of mortality and a selective blindness that 
helps to preserve the status quo. It is a symptom of our ongoing struggle 
to escape from the cycles of change in nature and establish an unnatural 
permanence in the world. Our mortality is frightening evidence that we 
do not have control over everything, and as such we are quick to ignore 
it, if we cannot do away with it altogether--a feat towards which our 
medical researchers are slowly working. It is worth questioning whether 
this would even be desirable. </p>
<p>Since the dawn of Western civilization, men and women have hungered for 
domination not only of the world and each other, but also for domination 
of the seasons, of time itself. We speak of the eternal grandeur of our 
gods and empires, and we design our cities and corporations to exist into 
infinity. We build monuments, skyscrapers, which we intend to stand forever 
as testimony of our victory over the sands of time. But this victory can 
only come at a price, at this price: that though nothing passes away, 
nothing comes to be, either--that the world we create is a static, standardized 
world that can hold no surprises for us any more. We would do well to 
be wary of fulfilling our own darkest dreams by creating such a dystopia, 
a frozen world in which no one must fear death any more, for everyone 
exists forever and no one lives for even an instant. </p>
