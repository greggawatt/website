<h1>How I Spent My  Permanent Vacation</h1>
<h6>by Brian D.</h6> 
<p> More than what I eat, whether or not I use drugs, and what bands I go 
to see, the bottom line for me as a member of the hardcore community and 
the counterculture in general is this: stay unemployed. Do whatever it 
takes, but keep my time and my labor to myself. I'm proud to say that 
it's been over three years now since I worked at any job for someone else. 
Here's why&#151;and how. </p>
<h3>WHY</h3> 
<p> First of all, and most importantly, there just isn't any other feeling 
that can compare with the sensation of complete freedom and self-determination. 
I wake up in the morning, when I want to, and make plans to do things 
that day&#151;to do what I want to. Nobody can buy a beautiful sunny day away 
from me at seven dollars an hour. If I suddenly have a new inspiration 
or idea, I can pursue it spontaneously without having to worry about how 
it will reflect on my future employment. I'm free to suddenly go on tour 
with my favorite band, to accidentally run into an old friend and spend 
the day catching up on lost time, or to stay home all day and write the 
first chapter of a novel if I am moved to. So my life contains a great 
deal more diversity and spontaneous opportunity than it would otherwise. 
And because I don't have to do the same thing over and over every day, 
all day (for example, sell real estate, wait tables, or program computers), 
I can do enough different things to keep everything fresh and exciting. 
</p>
<p> And of course I do things! I don't just hang out or sit around&#151;I have 
all the energy that would otherwise be drained from me at work free to 
use on all the projects I care about. I can go to the library here (it's 
only $10, for anyone, for a yearly membership at the university library 
here&#151;that even includes their video and CD libraries) and read or watch 
old movies, I can exercise, I can play music, write, do all sorts of creative, 
self-improving, productive things. If I had been working the past three 
years, it would have been impossible for me to have made Inside Front 
what it is&#151;I wouldn't have had the time or energy to research and write 
it, to organize and publish it, or to distribute it the way I have. The 
same goes for Catharsis, the band I play in; the music we have made and 
the experiences we have had traveling and performing mean more to me than 
any amount of money ever could, and Catharsis has taken up a lot of time 
that I wouldn't have had if I worked. The same goes for my involvement 
in CrimethInc.&#151;because I don't sell my time to some office or business 
establishment, I have time of my own to dedicate to helping bands that 
I love get their music packaged the way it should be and available to 
others. The same goes for my involvement in other projects&#151;writing for 
other magazines and pamphlets, fliering, and being active in my community 
in other ways. If I worked, even if it was at a job I liked (at a cafe 
with a relaxed atmosphere, etc.), I might not be unhappy, but my life 
certainly would not be as fulfilling as it has been with all of these 
activities in it in place of traditional employment. </p>
<p> Better yet, I get to work on these things that I care about however 
I see fit. I'm not following instructions, attempting to impress anyone 
who will be evaluating me for a promotion, or working within the confines 
of any restrictions on my efforts. I have completely free reign for my 
creativity. I can decide for myself how and when I will be most productive, 
rather than having to show up at work at 9 am every day whether that is 
good for my concentration or not. Thus I can make myself more effective 
and efficient than any boss ever could. </p>
<p> Finally, and most importantly, I'm voting both with my dollars and my 
time and energy against the existing system. I don't approve of the way 
most of my friends are treated in their places of employment; they usually 
have to deal with overbearing or incompetent managers, their tasks are 
often boring and repetitive, and they are typically not even given enough 
money to be able to take care of all their needs (many of which needs&#151;nice 
clothes, transportation, etc.&#151;are created by their jobs). I don't approve 
of the way many corporations conduct business (i.e. mistreating and slaughtering 
animals, destroying the environment, exploiting their workers, supporting 
governments that oppress and exploit their citizens, making products that 
are harmful to humans and the environment, etc.) and I also don't approve 
of the way our economy functions (with so many companies being interconnected 
and owned by multinational corporations) to force us to practically support 
the entire system whenever we support any particular company. When I don't 
work for them, they don't get to use my labor to perpetuate the status 
quo. When I don't receive an income from them, I don't have capital to 
give back to them for them to use to perpetuate the status quo. And most 
of all, my time and energy are mine to be used to fight against them, 
rather than to support present conditions. For example&#151;how many of you 
know vegans who work at places that serve meat and dairy products, or 
other people in similar situations? We have to get away from that sort 
of thing. </p>
<h3>HOW</h3>
<p> Really, everybody already knows everything I've just described. Most 
people, if they had the choice, would love to leave their jobs or at least 
get new ones. Well-publicized, reputable poles have estimated the proportion 
of Americans unhappy with their jobs to be as high as 90%. That's shocking, 
considering that our work is usually the most central and important thing 
in our lives. But people don't feel that they have any alternatives. The 
companies they work for will only let them have the goods and services 
they need to survive if they earn the money to pay for them. </p>
<p> My solution to that problem is to see which goods and services I can 
do without, and to look elsewhere for the others. I don't buy Pepsi to 
drink with every meal&#151;that stuff isn't too good for you anyway, and Pepsi 
Co. is involved in some really bad shit. I don't spend a lot of money 
in bars or nightclubs; there are plenty of free activities I can do with 
my friends that are just as exciting. I don't buy fashionable or expensive 
clothing. I don't spend money on expensive amenities that are supposed 
to "save time"&#151;because the truth is, they don't. Otherwise, where the 
fuck is all the time we should have saved up by now with our fast food, 
our microwave ovens, our automobiles, our fax machines, our computers? 
We're busier than ever today, overloaded with so many different demands 
on our time from these different "time-saving" devices and the jobs we 
work at to buy them. </p>
<p> So where do I get food, shelter, and other necessities? Food&#151;I almost 
never pay for it. Here, even in North Carolina, which is not too diverse 
socially or culturally, we have this thing called Food Not Bombs. F.N.B. 
is basically a group of people who go to all the restaurants, grocery 
stores, etc. and collect the food they are going to throw away at the 
end of each day&#151;because it's no secret that a LOT of perfectly good food 
goes to waste in those places. F.N.B. then serves this food downtown so 
that everyone who is hungry can have food to eat. I eat there twice a 
week, and each time they have a fair bit of food (bread, vegetables, canned 
food, etc.) left over that I can take home with me. Even if your town 
has nothing like Food Not Bombs, you can put the ideas into practice easily 
enough&#151;before F.N.B. started here, I used to go to my friend's burrito 
shop and collect the beans, chips, and rice they would have thrown away 
at closing time. The Hare Krishnas serve free dinners here too, once a 
week, and I have no scruples about eating their food&#151;who knows what they 
would do with those resources if they weren't spending them on keeping 
me fed? You can probably find similar opportunities that are unique to 
your area if you look. The consumer economy thrives on excess, so why 
not take advantage of it? Obviously this system wouldn't work if everybody 
in the world tried to do it, but that's not going to happen for a long 
time, if it ever does... so in the meantime we should get by however we 
can as individuals. We'll worry about arranging a completely work-free 
world when that actually looks like it might be in range. </p>
<p> Far too many useful things besides food are thrown away in our conspicuously 
consuming society, for that matter. You can get nice furniture that college 
students leave by the dumpsters at the end of the school year when they 
move out of their apartments. I have friends who have found everything 
from working clocks, stereos, and vacuum cleaners to new athletic shoes 
in dumpsters. And if you find the right thrift shop (not "vintage clothing" 
shop) you can dress yourself pretty well for less pocket change than you 
can scrape out of a public fountain in one night. </p>
<p> Shelter is the second most serious challenge to a person who wants to 
avoid working (health care is the most serious, and I don't have any easy 
answers for that one yet). In Europe and, to a lesser extent, New York, 
squatting is a possibility. People often complain to me that squats are 
too dirty and dangerous for them, but I think if the people who do not 
choose to live under dirty and dangerous conditions normally were to organize 
squats of their own, that (obviously) their squats would not be too dirty 
or dangerous. Think how much fucking money you could save if you didn't 
pay rent! Even if squatting is not an option (since it is sort of discouraged 
by the authorities), it's possible to arrange cheap places to live. Plenty 
of people I know pay only a little over a hundred dollars a month to share 
an old house with a bunch of friends. I've known people who have been 
paid to stay at someone's house and take care of it while they were gone; 
I've known people who have worked on the house where they lived (painted 
it, etc.) in exchange for paying little or no rent; the list goes on. 
The possibilities are endless and ever changing, so I can only give examples 
here&#151;you have to find concrete opportunities for yourself. </p>
<p> As for things that have to do with the hardcore scene&#151;often if you're 
active, doing something that is useful to people (because I'm trying to 
encourage that here by speaking out against work, NOT discourage it!) 
you can barter it for the records, 'zines., etc. that you're interested 
in. If you write reviews, you can get all that stuff for free; you could 
trade a traveling band food or a place to sleep in return for their record; 
you could trade some rare records for a tattoo or vice versa; trade a 
copy of your friend's 'zine for another one that interests you; volunteer 
to help organize and clean up after a show in return for free admission. 
</p>
<p> Another way to make ends meet when you're unemployed is&#151;brace yourself&#151;stealing 
from corporations. This can range from the very petty to the other side 
of the spectrum. You can get a variety of materials you may need from 
some simple, low risk urban hunting and gathering. Toilet paper is, obviously, 
everywhere; so are cleaning products, matches, salt and pepper, coathangers, 
cardboard boxes, light bulbs, batteries (you can get them out of smoke 
detectors, for example, if you don't think it will endanger anyone), staples 
and staplers, pens, soap&#151;just keep your eyes open. Copy shops often have 
tape, folders, markers, paper, and a million other typical "office" needs 
(it's a well-known fact that Kinko's has financed punk rock in the U.S.A. 
almost single-handedly). For that matter, stealing from the workplace 
is a time-honored American tradition, since so many people are so frustrated 
there; if you make friends with people who do work at these companies, 
chances are they will be happy to share a little of their companies' resources 
with you. Example? Since Inside Front #4, three years ago, I haven't paid 
for a single xerox copy; that includes thousands of copies of each issue 
from 4 through 7, thousands of pamphlets, and literally tens of thousands 
of fliers. </p>
<p> Do I feel bad about this? No. Corporations are distinct from traditional 
businesses in that they exist as separate financial entities from their 
owners. When you steal from a large corporation, you're stealing from 
a business entity that exists to perpetuate itself rather than from a 
private individual. Sure, private individuals profit from these corporations, 
and some of them are not really all that bad; others, though, like Pepsi 
or Marlboro, are up to some really bad things, and the less resources 
they have to pursue those goals the better. Most of the workers at these 
corporations receive a set salary, and will not suffer too much if you 
steal from the corporation. These corporations, in fact, usually figure 
some loss from theft, etc. into their budgets&#151;they know that's the price 
they must pay for doing business in an environment where their workers 
feel little loyalty to their employers or fulfillment in their work, and 
many people in society are hungry, fed up with their jobs, and fed up 
with being "honest" and waiting fruitlessly for change. If you actually 
did steal more from a company than they were prepared for, the people 
who will probably lose money are the stockholders&#151;and the majority of 
stock is not held by working class men and women who are counting on it 
to be able to take care of their families. And if so much theft somehow 
occurred that these huge corporations like Kmart and McDonalds had to 
close, I would shed no tears about it! These companies and the multinationals 
that own them would disappear, never again to wreak wholesale destruction 
upon the earth's environment, never again to sell the same unhealthy, 
nasty-tasting hamburgers in every town from Los Angeles to Moscow through 
sheer force of advertising dollars. Perhaps they would be replaced by 
individuals who could be held accountable for their behavior by their 
communities; individuals who would care about their communities and act 
accordingly, rather than having to obey the impersonal and disinterested 
orders of a faceless profit machine. Individuals like my friend who owns 
the Burrito shop, who would give me food when he knew I couldn't afford 
it&#151;because he knew I would do the same for him. </p>
<p> Anyway... Certainly, I'll admit it does take some time and energy to 
avoid working; you have to spend a fair bit of each figuring out how to 
survive without a steady income (at least you can do this on your own 
time, when and how you want to). Not to mention that you will have to 
go without some comforts and conveniences you may have been used to; but 
is that stuff really more important to you than anything else? Of course, 
more than anything else, it helps to have the support and camaraderie 
of your friends in an undertaking like staying unemployed, and that's 
where our hardcore community comes into this. </p>
<h3>How Does This Relate to Hardcore?</h3>
<p> Being a one-person economy is extremely difficult. Even if you don't 
work, you will still have no free time if you have to arrange all your 
food, all your shelter, all of your needs for yourself from scratch. But 
with others to work with, it becomes a lot easier. Food Not Bombs, the 
organization that I mentioned earlier, works so easily and smoothly because 
it is a group effort. Because a number of people help with obtaining the 
food, cooking, serving, and cleaning, it isn't that much work for any 
one individual, and the whole thing seems more like a friendly social 
event than a demanding task. The same goes for all the other ways of obtaining 
resources to stay unemployed&#151;not only are they easier in groups, but 
you will feel less alienated from the world if you do them with others. 
</p>
<p> Imagine if the hardcore scene wasn't just a bunch of kids wearing funny 
clothes, practicing their dance moves and camera angles at punk shows 
once every couple weeks. Imagine if everyone in the hardcore community, 
at least those who could (because of course not everyone can), quit their 
jobs and used all the potential energy we have as idealistic young people 
to try to develop a new way of life. We could use the networks we have 
already set up for touring bands, distribution, etc. to support each other 
in our attempt to break away from the employment system. Imagine how much 
creative energy would be unleashed, if we all stopped exhausting ourselves 
for "the man" and put that energy back into our own lives! Surely, all 
together we would be able to make something like that work. And then we 
would no longer be just another subculture with our own characteristic 
"rebellious music" and "fashionable clothing." We would be a fucking counterculture, 
a force that would work effectively against the status quo we all claim 
to reject&#151;for the contents of our daily lives would, by themselves, do 
more to change the way the world works than our words ever could. </p>
<p> Does this sound difficult? It probably will be! But whether it is impossible 
or not can only be determined by trying it. And besides, what do we have 
to lose? Are our diet sodas and home entertainment systems really worth 
the lives we must sell away to buy them? </p>
