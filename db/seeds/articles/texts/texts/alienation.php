<h1>AlieNation: The Map of Despair</h1>
<h5>Space/Time Control, Space Travel,<br />and Space 
Exploration</h5>
<b> </b> 
<p> In the modern world, control is exerted over us automatically by the 
spaces we live and move in. We go through certain rituals in our lives&#151;work, 
"leisure," consumption, submission&#151;because the world we live in is 
designed for these alone. We all know malls are for shopping, offices 
are for working, ironically-named "living" rooms are for watching television, 
and schools are for obeying teachers. All the spaces we travel in have 
pre-set meanings, and all it takes to keep us going through the same motions 
is to keep us moving along the same paths. It's hard to find anything 
to do in Walmart but look at and purchase merchandise; and, accustomed 
to doing this as we are, it's hard to conceive that there could be anything 
else we could do there anyway&#151;not to mention that doing anything 
but shopping there is pretty much illegal, when you think about it. There 
are fewer and fewer free, undeveloped spaces left in the world where we 
can let our bodies and minds run free. Almost every place you can go belongs 
to some person or group which has already designated a meaning and proscribed 
use for it: private estate, shopping district, superhighway, classroom, 
national park. And our very predictable routes through the world rarely 
take us near the free areas that do remain. These spaces, where thought 
and pleasure can be free in every sense, are being replaced with carefully 
controlled environments like Disneyland&#151;places in which our desires 
are prefabricated and sold back to us at our financial and emotional expense. 
Giving our own meaning to the world and creating our own ways to play 
and act in it are fundamental parts of human life; today, when we are 
never in spaces that encourage this, it should be no surprise that so 
many of us feel desperate and unfulfilled. But because the world has so 
little free space left in it, and the circuitry of our everyday lives 
never takes us there, we're forced to go to places like Disneyland for 
any semblance of play and excitement at all. Thus the real adventure our 
hearts crave has been largely replaced by fake adventure, and the thrill 
of creation by the drill of spectatorship. </p>
<p> Our time is as thoroughly occupied and regulated as our space; indeed, 
the subdivision of our space is a manifestation of what has already happened 
to our time. The entire world moves and lives according to a standardized 
time system, designed to synchronize our movements from one side of the 
planet to the other. Inside of this larger system, we all have our lives 
regimented by our work schedules and/or school hours, as well as the hours 
that public transportation runs and businesses operate, etc. This scheduling 
of our lives, which begins in childhood, exerts a subtle but deep control 
over us all: we come to forget that the time of our lives is ultimately 
ours to spend how we choose, and instead think in terms of work days, 
lunch hours, and weekends. A truly spontaneous life is unthinkable to 
most of us; and so-called "free" time is usually just time that has been 
scheduled for something other than work. How often do you get to see the 
sun rise? How many sunny afternoon walks do you get to take? If you had 
the unexpected opportunity to take an exciting trip this week, could you 
do it? </p>
<p> These restricting environments and schedules drastically limit the vast 
potential of our lives. They also keep us isolated from each other. At 
our jobs, we spend a great deal of time doing one particular kind of labor 
with one particular group of people, in one set place (or at least in 
one set environment, for construction workers and "temp" employees). Such 
limited, repetitive experience gives us a very limited perspective on 
the world, and keeps us from coming to know people from other backgrounds. 
Our homes isolate us further: today we keep ourselves locked apart in 
little boxes, partly out of fear of those capitalism has treated even 
worse than ourselves, and partly because we believe the paranoia propaganda 
of the companies that sell security systems. Today's suburbs are cemeteries 
of community, the people packed separately into boxes... just like our 
supermarket products, sealed for "freshness." With thick walls between 
us and our neighbors, and our friends and families scattered across cities 
and nations, it's hard to have any kind of community at all, let alone 
share community space in which people can benefit from each other's creativity. 
And both our homes and our jobs keep us tied down to one place, stationary, 
unable to travel far through the world except on hasty vacations. </p>
<p> Even our travel is restricted and restricting. Our modern methods of 
transportation&#151;cars, buses, subways, trains, airplanes&#151;all keep us locked 
onto fixed tracks, watching the outside world go by through a screen, 
as if it were a particularly boring television show. Each of us lives 
in a personal world that consists mostly of well-known destinations (the 
workplace, the grocery store, a friend's apartment, the dance club) with 
a few links in between them (sitting in the car, standing in the subway, 
walking up the staircase), and little chance to encounter anything unexpected 
or discover any new places. A man could travel the freeways of ten nations 
without seeing anything but asphalt and gas stations, so long as he stayed 
in his car. Locked onto our tracks, we can't imagine truly free travel, 
voyages of discovery that would bring us into direct contact with brand 
new people and things at every turn. </p>
<p> Instead, we sit in traffic jams, surrounded by hundreds of people in 
the same predicament as ourselves, but separated from them by the steel 
cages of our cars&#151;so they appear to us as objects in our way rather than 
fellow human beings. We think we are reaching more of the world with our 
modern transportation; but in fact we see less of it, if anything. As 
our transportation capabilities increase, our cities sprawl farther and 
farther across the landscape. Whenever travel distances increase, more 
cars are needed; more cars demand more space, and thus distances increase 
again... and again. At this rate highways and gas stations will one day 
replace everything that was worth traveling to in the first place. </p>
<p> A curious effect of the development of rapid transit systems is that 
as the distance between communities closes, the distance between individuals 
within those communities widens. </p>
<p> Some of us look at the internet as the "final frontier," as a free, 
undeveloped space still ripe for exploring. Cyberspace may or may not 
offer some degree of freedom to those who can afford to use and explore 
it; but whatever it might offer, it offers on the condition that we check 
our bodies at the door: voluntary amputation. Remember, you are a body 
at least as much as a mind: is it freedom to sit, stationary, staring 
at glowing lights for hours, without using your senses of taste, touch, 
or smell? Have you forgotten the sensations of wet grass or warm sand 
under bare feet, of eucalyptus tree or hickory smoke in your nostrils? 
Do you remember the scent of tomato stems? The glint of candlelight, the 
thrill of running, swimming, touching? </p>
<p> Today we can turn to the internet for excitement without feeling like 
we have been cheated because our modern lives are so constrained and predictable 
that we have forgotten how joyous action and motion in the real world 
can be. Why settle for the very limited freedom that cyberspace can provide, 
when there is so much more experience and sensation to be had out here 
in the real world? We should be running, dancing, canoeing, drinking life 
to the dregs, exploring new worlds&#151;what new worlds? We must rediscover 
our bodies, our senses, the space around us, and then we can transform 
this space into a new world to which we can impart meanings of our own. 
</p>
<p> To this end, we need to invent new games&#151;games that can take place in 
the conquered spaces of this world, in the shopping malls and restaurants 
and classrooms, that will break down their proscribed meanings so that 
we can give them new meanings in our accordance with our own dreams and 
desires. We need games that will bring us together, out of the confinement 
and isolation of our private homes, and into public spaces where we can 
benefit from each other's company and creativity. Just as natural disasters 
and power outages can bring people together and be exciting for them (after 
all, they do make for a little thrilling variety in an otherwise drearily 
predictable world), our games will join us together in doing new and exciting 
things. We will have poetry in the factories, concerts in the streets, 
sex in the fields and libraries, free picnics in supermarkets, public 
fairs on freeways. </p>
<p> We need to invent new conceptions of time and new modes of travel, as 
well. Try living without a clock, without synchronizing your life with 
the rest of the busy, busy world. Try taking a long trip on foot or bicycle, 
so that you will encounter everything that you pass between your starting 
point and your destination firsthand, without a screen. Try exploring 
in your own neighborhood, looking on rooftops and around corners you never 
noticed before&#151;you'll be amazed how much adventure is hidden there waiting 
for you!</p>
