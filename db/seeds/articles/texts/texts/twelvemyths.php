<h1>Twelve Myths About Direct Action</h1>
<p>Direct 
action&#8212;that is, any kind of action that bypasses established 
political channels to accomplish objectives directly&#8212;has 
a long and rich heritage in North America, extending back 
to the Boston Tea Party and beyond. Despite this, there 
are many misunderstandings about it, in part due to the 
ways it has been misrepresented in the corporate media.<br>
<h3>
1. Direct action is terrorism.</h3>
<p>Terrorism is calculated to intimidate and thus paralyze 
people. Direct action, on the other hand, is intended to 
inspire and thus motivate people by demonstrating the power 
individuals have to accomplish goals themselves. While terrorism 
is the domain of a specialized class that seeks to acquire 
power for itself alone, direct action demonstrates possibilities 
that others can make use of, empowering people to take control 
of their own lives. At most, a given direct action may obstruct 
the activities of a corporation or institution that activists 
perceive to be committing an injustice, but this is simply 
a form of civil disobedience, not terrorism.</p>
<h3>2. Direct action is violent.</h3>
<p>To say that it is violent to destroy the machinery of a 
slaughterhouse or to break windows belonging to a party 
that promotes war is to prioritize property over human and 
animal life. This objection subtly validates violence against 
living creatures by focusing all attention on property rights 
and away from more fundamental issues.</p>
<h3>3. Direct action is not political expression, but 
criminal activity.</h3><p>
Unfortunately, whether or not an action is illegal is a 
poor measure of whether or not it is just. The Jim Crow 
laws were, after all, laws. To object to an action on the 
grounds that it is illegal is to sidestep the more important 
question of whether or not it is ethical. To argue that 
we must always obey laws, even when we consider them to 
be unethical or to enforce unethical conditions, is to suggest 
that the arbitrary pronouncements of the legal establishment 
possess a higher moral authority than our own consciences, 
and to demand complicity in the face of injustice. When 
laws protect injustice, illegal activity is no vice, and 
law-abiding docility is no virtue.</p>
<h3>4. Direct action is unnecessary where people have 
freedom of speech.</h3><p>
In a society dominated by an increasingly narrowly focused 
corporate media, it can be almost impossible to initiate 
a public dialogue on a subject unless something occurs that 
brings attention to it. Under such conditions, direct action 
can be a means of nurturing free speech, not squelching 
it. Likewise, when people who would otherwise oppose an 
injustice have accepted that it is inevitable, it is not 
enough simply to talk about it: one must demonstrate that 
it is possible to do something about it.</p>
<h3>5. Direct action is alienating.</h3><p>
On the contrary, many people who find traditional party 
politics alienating are inspired and motivated by direct 
action. Different people find different approaches fulfilling; 
a movement that is to be broad-based must include a wide 
range of options. Sometimes people who share the goals of 
those who practice direct action while objecting to their 
means spend all their energy decrying an action that has 
been carried out. In doing so, they snatch defeat from the 
jaws of victory: they would do better to seize the opportunity 
to focus all attention on the issues raised by the action.</p>
<h3>
6. People who practice direct action should work through 
the established political channels instead.</h3><p>
Many people who practice direct action also work within 
the system. A commitment to making use of every institutional 
means of solving problems does not necessarily preclude 
an equal commitment to picking up where such means leave 
off.</p>
<h3>7. Direct action is exclusive.</h3><p>
Some forms of direct action are not open to all, but this 
does not necessarily mean they are without worth. Everyone 
has different preferences and capabilities, and should be 
free to act according to them. The important question is 
how the differing approaches of individuals and groups that 
share the same long-term goals can be integrated in such 
a way that they complement each other.</p>
<h3>8. Direct action is cowardly.</h3><p>
This accusation is almost always made by those who have 
the privilege of speaking and acting in public without fearing 
repercussions: that is to say, those who have power in this 
society, and those who obediently accept their power. Should 
the heroes of the French Resistance have demonstrated their 
courage and accountability by acting against the Nazi occupying 
army in the full light of day, thus dooming themselves to 
defeat? For that matter, in a nation increasingly terrorized 
by police and federal surveillance of just about everyone, 
is it any wonder that those who express dissent might want 
to protect their privacy while doing so?</p>
<h3>9. Direct action is practiced only by college students/privileged 
rich kids/desperate poor people/etc.</h3><p>
This allegation is almost always made without reference 
to concrete facts, as a smear. In fact, direct action is 
and long has been practiced in a variety of forms by people 
of all walks of life. The only possible exception to this 
would be members of the wealthiest and most powerful classes, 
who have no need to practice any kind of illegal or controversial 
action because, as if by coincidence, the established political 
channels are perfectly suited to their needs.</p>
<h3>10. Direct action is the work of agents provocateurs.</h3><p>
This is another speculation generally made from a distance, 
without concrete evidence. To allege that direct action 
is always the work of police agent provocateurs is disempowering: 
it rules out the possibility that activists could do such 
things themselves, overestimating the powers of police intelligence 
and reinforcing the illusion that the State is omnipotent. 
Likewise, it preemptively dismisses the value and reality 
of a diversity of tactics. When people feel entitled to 
make unfounded claims that every tactic of which they disapprove 
is a police provocation, this obstructs the very possibility 
of constructive dialogue about appropriate tactics.</p>
<h3>
11. Direct action is dangerous and can have negative repercussions 
for others.</h3><p>
Direct action can be dangerous in a repressive political 
climate, and it is important that those who practice it 
make every effort not to endanger others. This is not necessarily 
an objection to it, however--on the contrary, when it becomes 
dangerous to act outside established political channels, 
it becomes all the more important to do so. Authorities 
may use direct actions as excuses to terrorize innocents, 
as Hitler did when the Reichstag was set afire, but those 
in power are the ones who must answer for the injustices 
they commit in so doing, not those who oppose them. Likewise, 
though people who practice direct action may indeed run 
risks, in the face of an insufferable injustice it can be 
more dangerous and irresponsible to leave it uncontested.</p>
<h3>
12. Direct action never accomplishes anything.</h3><p>
Every effective political movement throughout history, from 
the struggle for the eight hour workday to the fight for 
women's suffrage, has made use of some form of direct action. 
Direct action can complement other forms of political activity 
in a variety of ways. If nothing else, it highlights the 
necessity for institutional reforms, giving those who push 
for them more bargaining chips; but it can go beyond this 
supporting role to suggest the possibility of an entirely 
different organization of human life, in which power is 
distributed equally and all people have an equal and direct 
say in all matters that affect them.</p>
