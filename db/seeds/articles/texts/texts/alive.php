<h1>Alive In The Land Of The Dead</h1>
<p>
The 20th Century has marked the end of the millennium that saw the 
world become colonized by and organized under Western civilization, 
that saw the industrial revolution and overpopulation restructure 
both humanity and the very surface of the earth itself. This century 
began with fifty years of alternating slaughter, starvation, and rabid 
nationalism such as the human race had never seen before. It is concluding 
with an ominous silence among young people in the United States and 
much of Europe, for with the end of the "Cold War" the idea that there 
really is any alternative at all to our modern living conditions and 
society is becoming hard to conceive of; and in the meantime, we are 
becoming more and more organized and arranged by the technological 
systems that we set up with the supposed intentions of making our 
lives more free and meaningful. </p>
<p> As this century is ending with sentimental retrospectives and the 
like, what we really must do is not look back but look ahead. Now more 
than ever we must consider whether our modern lives as we have come 
to live them over the last thousand years really satisfy all our needs 
and desires as human beings, and prepare for the new millennium to be 
a new chapter in the human experiment. We must use the lessons we have 
learned from the 20th Century to plan for a new era in which human life 
can be meaningful and fulfilling, even thrilling, heroic. Or have we 
learned any lessons? </p>
<p> Don't wait for permission, for some far-off "world revolution," for 
later "when you have more time." Demand joy, danger, passion in your 
life today! </p>
<h3>About the Problem</h3>
<p> The poverty against which man has been struggling throughout history 
is not merely the poverty of material goods; the ennui and disorientation 
experienced by the members of the middle and upper classes in today's 
wealthy industrial nations have revealed the poverty of Western existench 
itself. </p>
<p> The problems that we face today cannot be traced to class conflict 
alone. It is not merely a question of the ruling class profiting at 
the expense of the proletariat, for we have seen that the profit that 
those with capital do make does not make their lives any more fulfilling. 
It does not matter whether a woman is buried alive in a prison, in a 
reform school, in a sweatshop, in a ghetto, in a prestigious university, 
in a condominium bought on credit, or in a mansion with a private swimming 
pool and tennis courts, so long as she is buried alive. Everyone suffers 
from today's status quo, albeit differently; but whether a man is starving 
on his minimum wage salary, exhausted by his repetitive responsibilities 
at the office, or befuddled by the curious feeling of emptiness that 
accompanies the undirected acquisition of material wealth, he has a 
stake in fighting for change. So we all, rich and poor, must band together 
to consider our situation and struggle to alter it. </p>
<p> This also means that there is no mythical "They." Innumerable radical 
movements and social critics have relied upon this concept to motivate 
people by stirring up hatred for the "evil orchestrators" of human suffering, 
the enemies who conspire against us. But this kind of thinking only 
serves to divide us against each other, and whether we are divided on 
class lines, on color lines, or according to any other categories, we 
are distracted from the important issues and impeded in our progress. 
Our true "enemy" is the social forces and patterns at work between ourselves, 
and it is these forces which we must come to understand and to struggle 
against. </p>
<p> This is not to say that there are not individuals whose behavior is 
particularly dangerous to their fellow human beings, insofar as it perpetuates 
or intensifies our present state of emergency. But even if these individuals 
do have negative intentions towards others, it is still unlikely that 
they possess a clear understanding of the extremely complicated conditions 
to which they are contributing. </p>
<h3>About the Process</h3>
<p> We individuals who are unsatisfied with their lives, who do feel the 
"poverty" of the existench that modern Western civilization has to offer, 
must seek out others who are experiencing similar symptoms. Together, 
we must construct and publicize an analysis of our situation: a theory 
of why human beings act and interact in the ways that they do today, 
and how this leads to our sensations of alienation, disorientation, 
and exhaustion. </p>
<p> This analysis must have effective action of some kind as its necessary 
and immediate consequence, or else (as have the theories of a long tradition 
of "radical" discussion groups) it will come to nothing. </p>
<p> And this struggle presupposes participants who are fighting for themselves, 
to see and feel change and improvement in the course of their own lives&#151;as 
we shall see&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<h3>About the Solution</h3> 
<p> Whatever solution, whatever revolution, we propose, must be present-oriented 
rather than future-oriented if it is to be genuinely revolutionary. 
</p>
<p> The past and the present are both full of examples which indicate 
this. To consider one: Christianity demands of its followers that they 
delay gratification until they enter the next world, when they will 
supposedly be rewarded for their proper conduct; in doing so it assumes 
that this proper conduct is not fulfilling enough in itself to be worthwhile 
unless it is rewarded. This kind of thinking reflects a dire misunderstanding 
of the nature of human happiness; for happiness is to be found in activity, 
in activities that are exciting and satisfying in and of themselves, 
rather than in passively awaiting rewards for unsatisfying activities. 
Therefore it is not surprising that many devout Christians are bitter, 
spiteful individuals who jealously resent healthy activity and excitement 
in others&#151;for they believe that they will find true happiness only 
in their "heavenly reward" for behavior that is not at all exciting 
for them, and thus must watch enviously as others freely do what they 
can only dream of doing in their most "sinful" fantasies. Conversely, 
many Christians who are happy are happy despite their Christianity, 
because they are able to take pleasure in their lives and deeds in this 
world. </p>
<p> Traditional Marxism takes the Christian mistake one step further by 
asking its adherents to work towards a revolution they will probably 
never live to see&#151;that is, in the Marxist "faith," gratification is 
delayed beyond the reach of human experience. It should be no surprise 
that today, beyond a little anachronistic romanticism about the "nobility" 
of self-sacrifice, the Marxist offer serves as little incentive for 
people to seriously fight for the "communist revolution." In contrast, 
today's capitalistic consumer market at least promises prompt gratification 
in the form of material goods (and the myths and images it associates 
with them) in return for the generally unsatisfying labor it requires. 
But&#151;does it deliver true gratification to its participants? </p>
<p> Again, happiness is an active experience, not a passive sensation. 
Thus, a woman who cooks a recipe of her own invention for her friends 
may find a great deal of pleasure and meaning in this undertaking, while 
a man who slaves all day to cook exotic food in an expensive restaurant 
will find that the purchases he makes with his paycheck cannot compensate 
him for the days of his life he has given up. You can purchase a twenty 
acre estate, the latest in status-symbol automobiles, and an entire 
wardrobe of unique and exquisite fashions, but the pleasure that these 
possessions afford cannot compare to the exhilaration of spending a 
day freely pursuing your desires. </p>
<p> Accordingly, our revolution must be an immediate revolution in our 
daily lives; anything else is not a revolution but a demand that once 
again people do what they do not want to do and hope that this time, 
somehow, the compensation will be enough. Those who assume, often unconsciously, 
that it is impossible to achieve their own desires&#151;and thus, that it 
is futile to fight for themselves&#151;often end up fighting for an ideal 
or cause instead. But it is still possible to fight for ourselves, or 
at least the experiment must be worth a try; so it is crucial that we 
seek change not in the name of some doctrine or grand cause, but on 
behalf of ourselves, so that we will be able to live more meaningful 
lives. Similarly we must seek first and foremost to alter the contents 
of our own lives in a revolutionary manner, rather than direct our struggle 
towards world-historical changes which we will not live to witness. 
In this way we will avoid the feelings of worthlessness and alienation 
that result from believing that it is necessary to "sacrifice oneself 
for the cause," and instead live to experience the fruits of our labors. 
. . in our labors themselves. </p>
<p> To put it another way, our revolution must be above all a revolution 
in the ways we live and think. It must be a recognition and rejection 
of the thought patterns and patterns of social interaction that have 
led us to today's unsatisfying existench, in favor of patterns of thought 
and interaction that will be satisfying in themselves. It must be a 
revolution in our motivations, replacing reward-motivated behavior with 
behavior that is intrinsically meaningful. It must be a revolution in 
our everyday lives. Rejecting boredom, exhaustion, and despair for excitement, 
danger, love, passion and compassion&#151;that is a revolution worth fighting 
for! And certainly there are large scale, long term goals that we must 
fight for, to make this revolution possible for all of us in the years 
to come; but we should fight for these goals not out of servitude to 
a doctrine or cause, but because it is exciting and invigorating today 
to strive for difficult and worthy objectives. </p>
<p> Alive in the land of the dead. They eat dead food with false teeth. 
Their buildings have false fronts, their radio and television stations 
broadcast dead air. They kill time as spectators of false images. Their 
corporations are guilty of false advertising, and their employment 'opportunities' 
offer only murderous mistreatment, lethal boredom, and fatal submission; 
they demand that you meet deadlines, that you pitch tent in the death 
camps. Does the dead end justify the means? They inhabit dead cities 
and make false moves, really going nowhere at all, treading day after 
day the same path of despair. Even their air is conditioned. They ask 
you to give your lives for their countries, for their religions, for 
their economies, leaving you with only. . . . Their system is organized 
by artificial intelligence and provides only virtual reality. Their 
culture will pin you down and bore you to death, their lifestyle is 
lifeless, their existench is a permanent deadlock. Everything about 
them is dead and false. The only thing that is unbearable is that nothing 
is unbearable. When will we demand more? </p>
<h5>The struggle is for life, for real life. Fight 
foul, life is real!</h5>
<h6><strong>Footnote:</strong> The word "revolution" may be amusing or off-putting to the 
modern reader, convinced as he is that effective resistance to the status 
quo is impossible and therefore not even worth considering. Gentle reader, 
we ask that you suspend your disbelief long enough to at least contemplate 
whether or not such a thing might be worthwhile if it were possible; 
and then that you suspend it further, long enough to recognize this 
disbelief for what it is&#151;despair!</h6>
