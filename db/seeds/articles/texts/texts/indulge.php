<h1>Indulge . . . &amp; Undermine</h1>
<p>Have you noticed&#151;exhortations to indulge yourself are always followed 
by suggestions? Adherents of doctrines seek footholds to claim territory 
within you, salesmen grasp for handles to jerk you around . . . from new-age 
prophets to advertisers, from pornographers to radicals, everyone exhorts 
you to &#147;pursue your desires,&#148; but the question remains: which 
ones? The &#147;real&#148; ones? Who decides which those are?</p>
<p>
This just makes it clear what&#146;s going on: a war for your soul on 
every front. And those much talked-about desires are all constructed, 
anyway&#151;they change, they&#146;re dependent on external factors, culture, 
the whole context and history of our society. We &#147;like&#148; fast 
food because we have to hurry back to work, because processed supermarket 
food doesn&#146;t taste much better, because the nuclear family&#151;for 
those who still have even that&#151;is too small and stressed to sustain 
much festivity in cooking and eating. We &#147;have to&#148; check our 
email because the dissolution of community has taken our friends and kindred 
far away, because our bosses would rather not have to talk to us, because 
&#147;time-saving&#148; technology has claimed the hours once used to 
write letters&#151;and killed all the passenger pigeons, besides. We &#147;want&#148; 
to go to work because in this society no one looks out for those who don&#146;t, 
because it&#146;s hard to imagine more pleasurable ways to spend our time 
when everything around us is designed for commerce and consumption. Every 
craving we feel, every conception we form, is framed in the language of 
the civilization that creates us.</p><p>
Does this mean we would want differently in a different world? Yes, but 
not because we would be free to feel our &#147;natural&#148; desires&#151;no 
such things exist. Beyond the life you live, you have no &#147;true&#148; 
self&#151;you are precisely what you do and think and feel. That&#146;s 
the real tragedy about the life of the man who spends it talking on his 
cell phone and attending business seminars and fidgeting with the remote 
control: it&#146;s not that he denies himself his dreams, necessarily, 
but that he makes them answer to reality rather than attempting the opposite. 
The accountant regarded with such pity by runaway teenage lovers may in 
fact be &#147;happy&#148;&#151;but it is a different happiness than the 
one they experience on the lam.</p><p>
If our desires are constructs, if we are indeed the products of our environment, 
then our freedom is measured by how much control of these environments 
we have. It&#146;s nonsense to say a woman is free to feel however she 
wants about her body when she grows up surrounded by diet advertisements 
and posters of anorexic models. It&#146;s nonsense to say a man is free 
when everything he needs to do to get food, shelter, success, and companionship 
is already established by his society, and all that remains is for him 
to choose between established options (bureaucrat or technician? bourgeois 
or bohemian? Democrat or Republican?). We must make our freedom by cutting 
holes in the fabric of this reality, by forging new realities which will, 
in turn, fashion us. Putting yourself in new situations constantly is 
the only way to ensure that you make your decisions unencumbered by the 
inertia of habit, custom, law, or prejudice&#151;and it is up to you to 
create these situations. Freedom only exists in the moment of revolution.</p><p>
And those moments are not as rare as you think. Change, revolutionary 
change, is going on constantly and everywhere&#151;and everyone plays 
a part in it, consciously or not. &#147;To be radical is simply to keep 
abreast of reality,&#148; in the words of the old expatriate. The question 
is simply whether you take responsibility for your part in the ongoing 
transformation of the cosmos, acting deliberately and with a sense of 
your own power&#151;or frame your actions as reactions, participating 
in unfolding events accidentally, randomly, involuntarily, as if you were 
purely a victim of circumstance.</p><p>
If, as idealists like us insist, we can indeed create whatever world we 
want, then perhaps it&#146;s true that we can adapt to any world, too. 
But the former is infinitely preferable. Choosing to spend your life in 
reaction and adaptation, hurrying to catch up to whatever is already happening, 
means being perpetually at the mercy of everything. That&#146;s no way 
to go about pursuing your desires, whichever ones you choose.</p><p>
So forget about whether &#147;the&#148; revolution will ever happen&#151;the 
best reason to be a revolutionary is simply that it is a better way to 
live. It offers you a chance to lead a life that matters, gives you a 
relationship to injustice so you don&#146;t have to deny your own grief 
and outrage, keeps you conscious of the give and take always going on 
between individual and institution, self and community, one and all. No 
institution can offer you freedom&#151;but you can experience it in challenging 
and reinventing institutions. When school children make up their own words 
to the songs they are taught, when people show up by the tens of thousands 
to interfere with a closed-door meeting of expert economists discussing 
their lives, that&#146;s what they&#146;re up to: rediscovering that self-determination, 
like power, belongs only to the ones who exercise it.</p>
<hr>
<p> Shout it over the rooftops: Culture can belong to us. We can make our 
own music, mythology, science, technology, tradition, psychology, literature, 
history, ethics, political power. Until we do, we&#146;re stuck buying 
mass-produced movies and compact discs made by corporate mercenaries, 
sitting faceless and immobilized at arena rock performances and sports 
events, struggling with other people&#146;s inventions and programs and 
theories that make less sense to us than sorcery did to our ancestors, 
shamefacedly accepting the judgments of priests and agony columnists and 
radio talk show hosts, berating ourselves for not living up to the standards 
set by college entrance exams and glamour magazines, listening to parents 
and counselors and psychiatrists and managers tell us we are the ones 
with the problems, buying our whole lives from the same specialists and 
entrepreneurs we sell them to&#151;and gnashing our teeth in secret fury 
as they cut down the last trees and heroes with the cash and authority 
we give them. These things aren&#146;t inevitable, inescapable tragedies&#151;they&#146;re 
consequences of the passivity to which we have relegated ourselves. In 
the checkout lines of supermarkets, on the dialing and receiving ends 
of 900 numbers, in the locker rooms before gym classes and cafeteria shifts, 
we long to be protagonists in our own epics, masters of our own fate.</p><p>
If we are to transform ourselves, we must transform the world&#151;but 
to begin reconstructing the world, we must reconstruct ourselves. Today 
all of us are occupied territory. Our appetites and attitudes and roles 
have all been molded by this world that turns us against ourselves and 
each other. How can we take and share control of our lives, and neither 
fear nor falter, when we&#146;ve spent those lives being conditioned to 
do the opposite?</p><p>
Whatever you do, don&#146;t blame yourself for the fragments of the old 
order that remain within you. You can&#146;t sever yourself from the chain 
of cause and effect that produced you&#151;not with any amount of willpower. 
The trick is to find ways to indulge your programming that simultaneously 
subvert it&#151;that create, in the process of satisfying those desires, 
conditions which foster new ones. If you need to follow leaders, find 
leaders who will depose themselves from the thrones in your head; if you 
need to &#147;lead&#148; others, find equals who will help you dethrone 
yourself; if you have to fight against others, find wars you can wage 
for everyone&#146;s benefit. When it comes to dodging the imperatives 
of your conditioning, you&#146;ll find that indulge and undermine is a 
far more effective program than the old heritage of &#147;renounce and 
struggle&#148; passed down from a humorless Christianity.</p><p>
To return, finally, to the original question&#151;yes, we too are making 
suggestions about which desires you pursue. We would be scoundrels to 
deny that! But we would be scoundrels not to make these suggestions, not 
to extol freedom and self-determination in a world that discourages them. 
Exhorting others to &#147;think for themselves&#148; is ironic&#151;but 
today, refusing to oppose the propaganda of the missionaries and entrepreneurs 
and politicians simply means abandoning our society and species to their 
control. There&#146;s no purity in silence. And liberty does not simply 
exist in the absence of control&#151;it is something we have to make together. 
Taking responsibility for our part in the ongoing metamorphoses of the 
world means not being afraid to take part in the making of our society, 
influencing and being influenced as we do.</p><p>
We make suggestions, we spread this propaganda of desire, because we hope 
by doing so to indulge our own programmed passion for propaganda in a 
way that undermines an order that discourages all of us from playing with 
our passions&#151;and so to enter a world of total liberty and diversity, 
where propaganda and power struggles alike are obsolete. See you on the 
other side.</p>
