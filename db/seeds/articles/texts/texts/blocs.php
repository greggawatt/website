<h4>Materials:</h4>
<li>Matching clothing that conceals the wearers&#8217; identities<br>
<li>Trust and communication<br>
<li>A mission</li>
<h4> 
Optional Materials:</h4>
<li>Provisions: water (plenty, especially if you&#8217;ll 
be dressed in hot gear or expect chemical weapons attacks), 
food (don&#8217;t rely on shops or shopkeepers in contested 
zones), etc.<br>
<li>Camouflage: different layers of clothing for different 
purposes or stages of the action<br>
<li>Defensive gear: banners, shields (possibly disguised as 
puppets or placards), steel-toed shoes (should still be 
comfortable for running!), body armor or padding, gas masks 
or goggles and bandannas soaked in lime juice (store in 
ziplock bags until necessary), rain coats or chemical protection 
gear (if there is a risk of chemical attack), whatever relevant 
medical supplies you know how to apply, etc<br>
<li>Offensive gear: spraypaint, projectiles, slingshots, signs 
or flags on thick poles (or just plain poles), molotov cocktails, 
bright lights (to obscure police or camera vision during 
night actions), ladders and/or bolt cutters for scaling 
or breaching barriers, etc.<br>
<li>Communications equipment: hand radios, cell phones, police 
scanners, flags, drums, shared codes for making internal 
announcements<br>
<li>Transportation: bicycles, enough change for the subway, 
keys to your SUV (easy there, killer, it&#8217;s just a 
joke!)</li>

<h3 style="padding-top: 2px">What is a Bloc? Are there other kinds 
besides the Black Bloc?</h3>
<p> You 
may have heard of the notorious Black Bloc, a venerable, 
if not doddering, anarchist tradition in which a mass of 
direct action enthusiasts gather, all wearing black clothing 
and masks, and engage in some level of illegal activity. 
This tactic has won some famous victories in the past couple 
decades, and failed utterly more times than anyone can count, 
too. The specific cultural characteristics that are associated 
with the Black Bloc tactic today can make it easy to overlook 
the long history of the Bloc tactic and the wide variety 
of applications for which it can be used. The Boston Tea 
Party, for example, was a perfect example of a Bloc at work: 
the participants organized secretly, wore matching disguises 
(though their choice to costume themselves as &#8220;Indians&#8221; 
wasn&#8217;t exactly politically correct), and engaged in 
a mass act of provocative property destruction; presumably 
their strategies for communication and mutual defense weren&#8217;t 
much different from those used by the famous Black Blocs 
that, a couple hundred years later, attacked similarly noxious 
coffee corporations in Seattle. Those who practice direct 
action would do well to keep in mind the wide range of scenarios 
in which a version of the Bloc approach can be useful.<br>
</p>
<h3>What 
is a Bloc good for?</h3>
<p> Acting 
in a Bloc is especially useful when some of the participants 
in the action expect they may break laws. When everyone 
in a group looks the same, it is difficult for the police 
or others to tell who did what. Most criminal activities 
are better carried off in a less obvious manner, of course, 
but there are situations in which it is necessary to step 
outside the limits in public. The Bloc tactic as it&#8217;s 
known these days is best for conditions in which the action 
called for occupies the grey area between overt and covert, 
and as such it must be applied carefully: if you participate 
with a Bloc in an entirely legal action, you may make a 
police target of yourself unnecessarily, or needlessly frighten 
bystanders; on the other hand, if you intend to engage in 
serious organized criminal activity, you might be better 
off doing so outside the traditional Bloc format, in a totally 
closed group, with the element of surprise and so on. It&#8217;s 
not a coincidence that people don&#8217;t liberate animals 
from fur factories in Black Blocs.</p>
<p> One 
of the positive sides of public Bloc activity is that, unlike 
entirely underground activity, it can create open-ended 
situations, in which the actions of a few can open the floodgates 
for others to join in. One of the many objectionable qualities 
of terrorism is that, at best, it is still a spectator sport; 
a Bloc, on the other hand, can be a participatory and contagious 
radicalizing experience. The most obvious way to facilitate 
this is to organize an open or semi-open Bloc. In an open 
Bloc, a general call goes out to all interested to gather 
and act in a Bloc; open meetings are held to discuss goals, 
strategies, and so on. The benefits of such an approach 
are that more people can be involved; the obvious drawback 
is that security is so compromised that the possibilities 
for action are severely limited. In a semi-open Bloc, the 
organizing takes place in secret, between people who know 
and trust each other, but when the Bloc itself comes together, 
others in Bloc attire are welcomed to it; in the past few 
years of Black Bloc activities, this has been the most frequent 
format. In such Blocs, it is still necessary that the participants 
be prepared to deal with infiltration, but they at least 
have the benefit of secure planning and internal structures. 
In an entirely closed Bloc, the participants prepare in 
secret and do not welcome the participation or company of 
any outsiders during the action. Even when such a Bloc is 
called for, it can still be valuable to act openly, as a 
Bloc, rather than covertly: the public nature of the action 
may send an important message, others outside the Bloc may 
be inspired to engage in similar actions of their own, the 
crowd cover itself might enable an escape that would be 
more difficult for those opting for a clandestine approach.</p>
<p> Besides 
getting away with public criminal acts, there are other 
reasons to act in a Bloc. Bloc participation can be really 
exciting, and good for morale&#8212;acting in a mass of 
people who are ostensibly prepared to do what they believe 
is right regardless of police intimidation is often a hell 
of a lot more empowering than chanting weakly with the liberals, 
and matching battle-dress is a ritual for inspiring courage 
that need not be abandoned to our uniformed enemies. A Bloc 
presence may convey important information: to the powers 
that be, don&#8217;t fuck with this march, or don&#8217;t 
you dare rig that jury; to allies or possible allies, don&#8217;t 
despair, we&#8217;re with you. Finally, anonymity: there 
are countless reasons to conceal your identity at mass actions. 
Even if you do not plan on committing any crimes, even if 
you don&#8217;t mind the secret service capturing your image 
for their files, you still do a great service to others 
by masking up and increasing the number of people who are 
disguised, thus making it more difficult for the police 
to keep up with all of you. Those others might not just 
be criminals, either; they might be foreigners who don&#8217;t 
want their participation in radical activities to be used 
as grounds for deportation, or teachers who don&#8217;t 
want to risk losing their jobs. Sometimes a masked crowd 
is unnecessarily intimidating to the public; sometimes few 
enough people are masking up, or police attention is so 
focused on the Bloc, that you may deem it safer not to draw 
attention to yourself by doing so, even if you may engage 
in illegal activities; and sometimes it&#8217;s better to 
show your neighbors where you stand, or let the public and 
the cameras see that not everyone involved in radical activity 
is young, white, and male. Otherwise, if others are masking 
up, you might as well do the same.</p>
<p> Those 
masks don&#8217;t necessarily have to be black ski masks, 
anyway; there are plenty of more fun, family-oriented ways 
to obscure your identity. Beyond the Black Bloc, endless 
possibilities open up: pink Blocs, clown Blocs, doctor Blocs, 
maintenance worker Blocs&#8230; Wherever there are a bunch 
of people wearing either identical clothing or costumes, 
the Bloc tactic could be deployed utilizing the matching 
crowd for camouflage. Halloween, for example, could offer 
a great opportunity for Bloc action&#8212;as could a high 
school graduation!<em><strong><br>
</strong></em></p>
<h3>Where and how can the Bloc tactic be applied?</h3>
<p> Black 
Bloc actions have been a hit at mass actions over the past 
couple decades: there have been Blocs in the protests at 
meetings of such despicable gangs as the World Trade Organization, 
at political events such as debates between presidential 
candidates, at anti-war demonstrations and solidarity marches 
with communities that are suffering police brutality. Wherever 
there is a mass gathering of protesters, it may make sense 
to deploy or call for a Bloc.</p>
<p> In 
such environments, the Bloc can serve many purposes. As 
mentioned before, it can simply be present as a promise 
of solidarity, or a threat. It can act as a line of defense 
for or a distraction from other activists doing civil disobedience 
actions such as lock-downs and blockades, who will be unable 
to defend themselves from the police. It can engage in property 
destruction: this can achieve economic ends, such as inflicting 
financial losses upon wicked corporations, or other practical 
goals: a city can be persuaded never to risk hosting another 
fill-in-the-blank, or alienated workers (and even activists!) 
can experience firsthand that the stranglehold their oppressors 
seem to have on reality can literally be broken. A Bloc 
can attempt to prevent delegates from reaching an unwanted 
meeting, or trap them inside the meeting space to make sure 
they get the message that their shenanigans are not welcome. 
It can reclaim urban space, opening up and protecting a 
street or park for others to reinterpret and enjoy, or rerouting 
a permitted march into unpermitted areas. It can engage 
the police in conflict, and thus disrupt business as usual&#8212;a 
meeting in Quebec City to discuss the Free Trade Area of 
the Americas agreement had to be halted temporarily when 
tear gas from the streetfighting below entered the vents 
of the building hosting it. It can offer the possibility 
of contesting power and control in immediate actions, rather 
than mere words, and thus keep spirits up and appetites 
whetted. A Bloc might attempt to set off full-scale rioting, 
in hope of precipitating an insurrection&#8212;or it could 
simply create a spectacle, to emphasize the anarchist presence 
and foreground its romantic appeal: liberal carping about 
&#8220;alienating the public&#8221; notwithstanding, the 
Black Blocs in Seattle and afterwards did as much to increase 
the mass appeal of anarchist action as any propaganda publication 
ever has. If nothing else, a Bloc action can be good practice 
for future such actions that may achieve more.</p>
<p> When 
choosing goals for a Bloc at a mass action, it is critical 
that the intentions, needs, and comfort levels of locals 
and others who will be involved or present be taken into 
account. Alienating people needlessly is not only counterproductive, 
but endangers Bloc participants; the police are already 
enough enemies for anyone breaking the law. The last thing 
you want to do is endanger others with your actions&#8212;don&#8217;t 
throw stones at the police from the back of a crowd, don&#8217;t 
risk provoking police attacks on peaceful marches, especially 
if you&#8217;re not planning on sticking around to bear 
the brunt of them. If you&#8217;re operating in a mostly 
out-of-town group that will be acting in a residential neighborhood, 
don&#8217;t be so arrogant as to think you should be the 
ones to decide what level of conflict is most appropriate 
for the situation&#8212;far better you show that you respect 
the needs and perspectives of the locals, and are willing 
to follow their lead. There may be cases in which it is 
appropriate to bring a level of intensity to an action that 
others aren&#8217;t prepared to&#8212;for example, if liberal 
organizers are addressing a gross injustice with useless 
gestures that will do nothing to put things right&#8212;but 
it&#8217;s good form to make sure that the first ones to 
pay the piper for whatever goes down will be you and your 
companions, not innocent bystanders.</p>
<p> Similarly, 
it is important to be realistic about what you can hope 
to accomplish in the situation at hand, given your experience, 
numbers, and other resources. If the local populace hates 
the arrogance of the leaders who are meeting in their city, 
but mistrusts the equally foreign hordes who have gathered 
there to protest them, it might make more sense to target 
those leaders than to smash corporate windows in what the 
locals might perceive as an outsiders&#8217; attack on their 
home streets. Take everything into account: the personality 
of the police force, the current local political climate, 
how aware others will be of what happens to you and your 
companions, whether the authorities will want to teach you 
a lesson this time or avoid inopportune media coverage, 
whether the police will be trying to secure the whole area 
(in which case you can expect them to attempt mass arrests, 
if they have the numbers) or simply protect a part of it 
(in which case they may resort to dispersal or defense tactics, 
if they are outnumbered or uncertain). Is your action intended 
for media coverage, for those who witness it in person, 
for those who participate in it, or for those who foot the 
bills? Is your goal worth the risk, is it appropriate to 
the event in question?</p>
<p> Outside 
the mass at mass actions, acting in a Bloc is a much riskier 
proposition, for the Bloc can be easily surrounded and neutralized 
by the police. Historically, at demonstrations, almost every 
Bloc that has mixed well with a much larger mass of law-abiding 
protesters has managed to maintain some degree of safety 
and coherence, while almost every Bloc that has attempted 
to operate in their absence has suffered or at least risked 
serious police repression. Some lessons we can draw from 
such previous successes and failures are:</p>
<p> 1. 
The Bloc should not operate without either the element of 
surprise or the benefit of broad crowd cover, at least not 
unless it is expected to be of vast numbers, high morale, 
and great defensive experience, or unless the purpose of 
the action is to get a lot of participants arrested.</p>
<p> 2. 
Announced direct actions (Blocs, unpermitted marches, etc.) 
at mass events should always take place on or before the 
big day of general protest, never after them. When direct 
action precedes or coincides with massive marches and gatherings, 
it often sets the tone for everything that follows, upping 
the ante and radicalizing the event in general; when direct 
action enthusiasts are the only ones left out on the street 
after the law-abiding activists have gone home, the police 
know they can isolate, abuse, and arrest them without fear 
of stepping on the toes of the &#8220;wrong&#8221; citizens, 
or being observed by such citizens as they do so. The presence 
of others who would witness police brutality is an important 
deterrent; work without it at your peril.</p>
<p> 3. 
Those operating in a Bloc need to have the support or at 
least the respect of some, if not most, of those outside 
the Bloc, so as to ensure their safety on the field, let 
alone general good will in the activist community. In one 
historic instance, a Black Bloc was surrounded and cornered 
by police, who were moving in to finish it off when a march 
organized by a liberal women&#8217;s organization was re-routed 
to pass through the area and provide members of the Bloc 
with an opportunity to blend in and escape. To this end, 
it helps a great deal if the goals or targets of the Bloc 
are instantly comprehensible to outsiders, so whether or 
not others agree with the tactic itself they can at least 
understand why it is being employed.</p>
<p> On 
the other hand, there are cases in which none of these rules 
of thumb is relevant. Entirely outside the realm of mass 
actions, as long as the element of surprise is present, 
there are many other environments in which the Bloc tactic 
can be applied; indeed, such applications may be the most 
promising for the future of the Bloc, now that police are 
very familiar with and prepared for Bloc presence at demonstrations. 
A Bloc operating swiftly and with the element of surprise 
against an unsuspecting target can accomplish a great deal, 
especially if it is of decent size. Consult the illustration 
at the end of this text for an example of how a Bloc can 
be deployed outside the demonstration format to wreak havoc 
on corporate and governmental property.</p>
<p> When 
acting in a Bloc with no demonstrating mass for cover, the 
most important advantage you have to work with is surprise. 
If you organize in such a way that the authorities in question 
don&#8217;t see your action coming, you may be able to get 
everything done and escape before they&#8217;re able to 
respond. Even when they do arrive, chances are they will 
not be prepared to make mass arrests, so you can expect 
them to attempt only to seize individuals; in this situation, 
the individuals carrying out high risk actions may be able 
to disappear in the commotion (enthusiasts of civil disobedience 
could even snarl the police up in petty arrests to facilitate 
this, though they might thus risk a conspiracy charge if 
they were connected to the Bloc)&#8212;or, if the group 
is able to act with a high degree of solidarity and audacity, 
staying close together and not permitting police to get 
their hands on individuals within it, it might be possible 
to negotiate a departure en masse, though you can expect 
to be followed at the very least. It has happened before 
that groups of activists breaking the law together, who 
showed that they would not be intimidated nor allow members 
to be picked off, have been permitted by unprepared police 
to leave an area in return for concluding their action. 
It&#8217;s also happened that they&#8217;ve had rubber bullets 
shot at them, though! If some of you are planning illegal 
activity of a serious nature, it may be a good idea to have 
others in your group applying a wide range of less confrontational 
tactics, so the police won&#8217;t be as likely to treat 
you all as hard-core criminals . Always be sure everyone 
in your group, especially the ones who aren&#8217;t keen 
on taking great legal risks, knows exactly what the highest 
level of possible illegal activity is in advance, as you 
never know whether the police will choose to hold others 
responsible for the actions of those they couldn&#8217;t 
catch!</p>
<p> If 
you&#8217;re showing up at a corporate office at sunrise, 
you can expect to be practically the only ones there, and 
you&#8217;ll have to count on speed and clever escape routes 
for your liberty; but there are other situations in which, 
just as at a demonstration, there will be crowd cover&#8212;even 
potentially supportive crowd cover&#8212;to melt into. Who 
knows, a Sports Fan Bloc mixing with the jubilant crowd 
celebrating a home team football victory might be able to 
touch off hard-core anti-corporate vandalism and looting!</p>
<p> When 
making plans and setting goals for a Bloc action in a particular 
context, it is always important to look back in history 
for precedents. If the last time someone tried something 
similar to what you are trying was a disaster, you had better 
figure out what new element you can throw in to give yourself 
a better chance. History tends to repeat itself&#8212;at 
least when we don&#8217;t use our ingenuity to derail it! 
Get familiar with the history of Bloc actions over the past 
few years; whenever you&#8217;re considering joining in 
one, pick out and consider the previous example that best 
indicates what you can expect from this one&#8212;keeping 
in mind, of course, that your adversaries have been doing 
the same, so counting on a particular stratagem to work 
twice is a risky proposition. It is at least as important 
to know when not to do a Bloc action as it is to know when 
to try one: unsuccessful attempts to act in Bloc, when there 
are not enough participants available or the conditions 
are not favorable, can sap energy better applied elsewhere. 
When you strike in Bloc, strike hard and impressively, then 
wait for the next realistic chance to do so again.</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p> Naturally, 
the affinity group is the basic building block of any Bloc. 
It is impossible to overstate the importance of engaging 
in Bloc activity as part of a small group capable of fending 
for itself and making decisions; to do otherwise is to abdicate 
responsibility for yourself to the mass, and to deny that 
mass the benefit of your participation as an equal. Blocs 
made up of self-sufficient affinity groups can make democratic 
decisions quickly, can split up into equally effective smaller 
groups, can handle stressful situations without the added 
stress of herding a flock of confused followers. It goes 
without saying that within your affinity group, you should 
establish common expectations about what goals are, what 
level of risk is acceptable, what kind of security is appropriate. 
Security is especially important in Bloc activities, because 
of the sketchy mix of public and unlawful activity that 
may be involved; be sure everyone has the same sense of 
security culture.</p>
<p> Regardless 
of the total size of the Bloc, each affinity group should 
be totally self-sustaining, at least in regards to the goals 
it intends to achieve. Escape routes, legal resources, emergency 
backup plans, knowledge of the area&#8212;every affinity 
group should have all of these. A buddy system inside a 
group is useful, so if the group itself is dispersed individuals 
can take responsibility for the safety and whereabouts of 
their partners. Internal roles can be assigned: for example, 
scouts who keep track of activity and police presence (these 
can be equipped with hand radios or cell phones with which 
to communicate with the main group, and can ride bicycles 
for extra speed and mobility; it usually makes the most 
sense to position them a block or so away from the group, 
so they can provide early warnings and broader perspective 
on the area), communications people (also with radios or 
cell phones, and perhaps a police scanner) to exchange information 
with the scouts and other groups, runners to communicate 
new information to nearby groups, experienced folks to correlate 
and consider information and take responsibility for making 
split-second decisions, persons to actually carry out the 
actions planned, lookouts to cover them, perhaps a flag-bearer 
or marching band to maintain morale and keep the group visible 
from a distance, and so on. It might be wise to have one 
person in non-Bloc clothing to attend the Bloc, to handle 
such tasks as explaining to spectators that they should 
not take photographs, for the police can seize their cameras 
and use the pictures in court. The role the affinity group 
plays in a larger group can also be specialized: an affinity 
group could serve as scouts for a larger Bloc, or set out 
to blockade a particular intersection, or concentrate on 
maintaining a banner at the front of a large group.</p>
<p> An 
affinity group can form a small, ad-hoc Bloc on its own, 
but a larger, more powerful Bloc can be formed as a cluster 
of affinity groups. In this case, it is critical that efficient 
and democratic structures be set up within the cluster. 
It should be possible for news, questions, and answers to 
be communicated swiftly between individuals within affinity 
groups and between affinity groups themselves, in even the 
tensest of situations. Some have argued in favor of a more 
militaristic Bloc model, that would presumably operate more 
like the hierarchical regiments our enemies pit against 
us, but the very strength of the Bloc is its decentralized, 
unpredictable nature; it seems foolish to try to beat our 
oppressors at their own game rather than capitalizing on 
our own strengths. Better we improve our coordination, rather 
than control: we are conductors setting the stage for improvisation, 
not military tacticians with underlings and commanding officers.</p>
<p> In 
a Bloc made up of affinity groups from different areas, 
the local group will inevitably have the most information 
about what is possible, and may well consequently have done 
the most thinking and preparing. This is not necessarily 
a problem, as long as others trust them and are organized 
enough themselves to retain their autonomy. The local group 
should make provisions for sharing as much information with 
others as is safe, and also be sure not to assume unthinkingly 
a position of authority over the other groups; a local group 
attempting to lead an uninformed mass on an unrevealed secret 
mission can be a real recipe for disaster.</p>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p> One 
of the most important things to do before an action is learn 
the area. As many members of each group as possible should 
spend time traversing it, taking careful note of escape 
routes and dead ends, cameras, places the police may mass 
or seek to protect, possible targets, possible resources 
(barricading materials such as moveable fences, etc.), and 
above all making sure they will not get lost. Those who 
cannot be there in advance should at least memorize maps. 
It is possible to get aerial maps off the internet, for 
locations for which street maps are unavailable or do not 
suffice.</p>
<p> Make 
sure you have safe accommodations before the action, if 
there&#8217;s any chance the police are expecting it. Far 
too many times, the police have raided activist housing 
before an action and arrested hundreds of people; do everything 
you can to find a place to sleep and prepare that is off 
their radar, so you won&#8217;t run that risk. Stay with 
a friend of your uncle, or rent sleeping space at a YMCA. 
Don&#8217;t be stuck trying to sleep in your car on the 
streets they&#8217;re patrolling in preparation for the 
next day&#8217;s riot! If you&#8217;re from out of town, 
make equally sure your traveling group (which may not be 
the same as your affinity group) has planned a safe regrouping 
and departure from the area, and has a backup plan in case 
of emergency. Keep in mind that if things really go off, 
certain parts of the city may be closed off to you after 
the action, so you&#8217;ll need to regroup elsewhere.</p>
<p> Advance 
meetings are a critical part of the preparation for most 
Blocs. Again, how secure or public these meetings are will 
depend on how many people (and with what level of direct 
action experience) you hope to involve, and what degree 
of legal risk you&#8217;re willing to take. If you&#8217;re 
trying to organize a massive but largely symbolic open Bloc, 
you might choose to circulate meeting times openly; if you&#8217;re 
organizing the core of a Bloc that will be open in the street 
but needs some preparation in private, tell others you trust 
to pass on an invitation to the meeting only to those they 
trust; if you&#8217;re preparing an entirely closed Bloc, 
not only should you only reveal the time and place of the 
meeting to your companions in the action, but you should 
also make sure they all know not to mention the existence 
of the project itself to anyone, and to have alibis ready 
so their other friends won&#8217;t wonder what they&#8217;re 
up to.</p>
<p> Meeting 
location is an important factor in security. You don&#8217;t 
want a place that can be monitored (no private residences), 
you don&#8217;t want a place where you can be observed all 
together (not the park across from the site of the next 
day&#8217;s actions), you don&#8217;t want a place where 
you can be seen entering and leaving or that someone could 
enter unexpectedly&#8212;post scouts, lock the door once 
things get started, watch out for anything suspicious. I&#8217;ll 
never forget exiting an ultra-high security meeting in a 
university basement only to discover that while we&#8217;d 
been locked in, a crowd of liberal student protestors had 
flooded the adjoining room to watch a slideshow&#8212;which 
all the organizers of the next day&#8217;s militant Black 
Bloc had to wade through in embarrassment! Oops! Small groups 
can take walks and chat; larger groups can meet in quiet 
outdoor settings&#8212;go hiking or camping, if there&#8217;s 
time&#8212;or in private rooms in public buildings, such 
as library study rooms or empty classrooms. Best case scenario: 
though he has no idea you&#8217;re involved in direct action, 
you&#8217;re close with the old guy who runs the caf&eacute; 
across town, and he doesn&#8217;t mind letting you have 
the back room one afternoon for a private party, no questions 
asked.</p>
<p> Once 
everyone is together, if the folks in attendance do not 
all know each other already you can establish the level 
of security by playing the &#8220;vouched for&#8221; game: 
each person puts a hand on someone else present they know 
and trust. Hopefully, everyone in the room will be touching, 
through one connection or another, and the meeting can begin 
with some degree of confidence in the air.</p>
<p> If 
you are part of an affinity group participating in a larger 
Bloc, you&#8217;ll want to have your own meetings first, 
so when a representative of your group attends the larger 
meeting she can present the information you have, the resources 
you have to offer, the goals you hope to achieve, and the 
plans you propose, according to how much of this you trust 
a larger number of people to know. If this is a mass action 
and there is a larger spokescouncil meeting taking place, 
at least one person from the Bloc or in communication with 
it should attend; it may or may not be safe for this person 
to identify herself as such, but she should at least be 
there to take note of what else is going on. A representative 
of the Bloc could attend the spokescouncil presenting herself 
as a part of an affinity group hoping to do support for 
those involved in Bloc activity, and thus test the waters 
or even meet others interested in the Bloc.</p>
<p> In 
the meetings with your affinity group and the Bloc, you&#8217;ll 
want to establish a plan of some kind for the day (these 
almost never come off as intended, but they help to get 
everyone in practice thinking about the situation, and it&#8217;s 
good to be prepared to have something to do in case everything 
does work out), and a structure to facilitate the Bloc communicating 
and making quick, democratic decisions, as described above. 
Structure will make you adaptable and thus effective, whether 
or not your plans come to fruition. You should establish 
a meeting point for the Bloc, plans for dispersal, and a 
possible time and place for regrouping, if that would be 
desirable should the Bloc be divided early. Share legal 
information, what resources will be available for those 
who are arrested. Go over every possible scenario, what 
you can expect from each other in each of them. Psychology 
is important here: plan for the worst, but don&#8217;t demoralize 
yourselves&#8212;you&#8217;re considering the possible problems 
so you&#8217;ll be ready for them, not to talk yourself 
out of action.</p>
<p> Finally&#8212;if 
there will be more than one language spoken among demonstrators 
or locals, make sure to learn a few important phrases in 
each of them: &#8220;we are not against you, we want no 
trouble with you,&#8221; &#8220;don&#8217;t run, walk!&#8221; 
&#8220;medical assistance needed!&#8221;</p>
<h3>During the action</h3>
<p> It 
is often wise to write the phone number of a legal contact 
on your body in permanent marker shortly before an action, 
so you can be sure it will be available to you if you are 
arrested, regardless of what else transpires. You may need 
to know other cell phone numbers and so on for the day&#8217;s 
actions: try to learn them by heart, or, failing that, write 
them on your skin in an ink that you can rub off if absolutely 
necessary. You&#8217;ll also want to have enough money on 
you for food, transportation, and phone calls, but no more, 
as that would probably disappear in the event of arrest. 
Remove piercings that could be torn out. Do not carry your 
address book, or unnecessary anarchist propaganda, or anything 
needlessly incriminating or illegal; take your I.D. with 
you if you want to be processed as your &#8220;true&#8221; 
identity in the event of arrest, make sure you have no identifying 
papers on you if you plan on withholding your identity from 
the police in that event. Carry plenty of water and high-energy 
foods with you; be prepared for emergencies&#8212;if you 
get separated from everyone and have to spend the night 
hiding out in a dumpster, you don&#8217;t want to be starving 
too&#8212;but don&#8217;t weigh yourself down with anything 
unnecessary. Carry with you whatever first aid supplies 
you know how to use that might be useful. Be aware of what 
medical assistance&#8212;such as street medics and clinics&#8212;is 
going to be present in the streets, and have a plan if you 
have to go to a hospital (a fake name and social security 
number, and an alibi, if you fear you might encounter police 
there); be similarly aware of whether legal observers and 
media will be present in the streets, and whether you&#8217;ll 
want them around or far away from you.</p>
<p> Be 
prepared for the situation at hand. If the police outnumber 
you, are waiting for you, and there are reporters and civilians 
in the area, don&#8217;t come in a gas mask and body armor 
like the folks in your favorite street riot photographs&#8212;they&#8217;re 
not going to gas and beat you, they&#8217;re going to try 
to encircle and arrest you, and you&#8217;ll need to be 
able to move quickly and blend well to avoid it.</p>
<p> Clothing 
is the one essential feature of the Bloc tactic, and the 
rock upon which it rests or founders. Far away from the 
action itself, you may want to practice moving and acting 
freely in your Bloc gear, so you won&#8217;t still be getting 
used to it when it&#8217;s too late. The whole idea of a 
Bloc is to look indistinguishable from each other, so make 
sure whatever your Bloc theme is, everyone is on the same 
page about it, and that your own clothing doesn&#8217;t 
bear any features that distinguish it. In a worst-case scenario, 
you can make a t-shirt into a mask: use the neck hole for 
your eyes, tie the sleeves behind your head.</p>
<p> Your 
clothing should protect you from the hazards you expect, 
while not weighing you down unnecessarily; it should be 
adaptable should unexpected situations arise. Layers are 
key: if possible, wear an outer layer in which to travel 
to the Bloc action, a layer of Bloc clothing, and then another 
layer of getaway clothing beneath this&#8212;without risking 
hyperthermia, of course. It may be most sensible to carry 
the outer layer of your getaway layer in a sealed bag, in 
case you are covered in paint, tear gas, etc. by the time 
you need to use it. If you expect chemical weapons attacks, 
wear a waterproof outer layer that admits no access, and 
under that synthetic fibers that won&#8217;t absorb chemicals 
(cotton will). For serious confrontations, choose a gasmask 
with shatter-proof lenses and replaceable non-asbestos filters 
that won&#8217;t obscure your vision too much; otherwise, 
you can breathe through a bandanna soaked in vinegar or 
lime juice (transport the bandanna to the action in a sealed 
bag; you can carry a lime or two with you to keep it fresh) 
and wear swimming goggles (these can be obtained in prescription 
form for those who wear eyeglasses; when not wearing them 
over your eyes, keep them inside out on your forehead so 
they won&#8217;t fog up). You can add a particle mask underneath 
the bandanna for extra protection. I&#8217;ve read that 
ear plugs can offer some protection against concussion grenades, 
but how one is supposed to know when to put them in and 
when to have them out so as to be appropriately attentive 
is beyond me. If you expect to risk receiving blows or projectile 
fire, wear body armor of some kind (sports gear can suffice) 
and foam or padding, and a bicycle or motorcycle helmet.</p>
<p> A 
Bloc that intends to defend territory in clashes with the 
police may decide to use shields. These can be made from 
trash can lids or cut traffic barrels, inflatable rafts 
or inner tubes heavily reinforced with duct tape and possibly 
a layer of tarp, good old-fashioned cardboard, or layered 
(super-glued together) and reinforced plexiglass. Soften 
up the handles with a thick wrapping of duct tape so the 
shock of impact won&#8217;t break your wrists, and provide 
plenty of room on the grip so your knuckles don&#8217;t 
take all the blow. Larger shields are better for protecting 
against projectile weapons or functioning as a mobile barricade, 
while smaller ones provide better mobility and serve better 
in hand-to-hand combat. A line of individual shield-bearers 
can form a shield wall, especially if they are practiced 
at moving together; alternatively, massive multi-person 
shields can be constructed, such as the insulation board 
placards mentioned below. The latter shields should have 
enough joints in them to navigate narrower streets; keep 
in mind that these joints are also their weakest points.</p>
<p> Slapstick 
as it is, it often happens that comrades who discussed and 
prepared together will not be able to recognize each other 
in their Bloc gear on the day of the action. You may want 
to identify yourselves to each other early on, especially 
people from different cities and affinity groups who intend 
to work together, so it will be easier to keep up with each 
other in the chaos.</p>
<p> The 
moment the Bloc forms can be pivotal. Where and when to 
mask up is a hard question: if you do it too late, once 
you&#8217;ve joined the Bloc, you risk being identified; 
if you do it too early, before you&#8217;ve joined the Bloc, 
you risk being nabbed by the police. Little masked groups 
walking around before or after events are perfect targets 
for their enemies. At a big demonstration, one of the best 
options is to get in your gear in the midst of a large crowd 
that is not yet under much surveillance, with people around 
you that you trust, and to move in the body of the crowd 
to a meeting point with your fellows in the Bloc. Wearing 
layers is important here, too: if you can start in a disposable 
outermost layer that makes you look like a civilian or liberal 
activist (if perhaps one overdressed for the weather), masking 
up will simply mean discarding it and simultaneously pulling 
up your mask. At an action in which you have the benefit 
of surprise, you can always pick a safe, quiet place near 
your convergence point and mask up there.</p>
<p> In 
a mass action situation, the convergence of the Bloc should 
never occur before other protesters are out in the streets; 
once again, the police will simply pick off the Bloc when 
no one else is there to provide crowd cover or bear witness. 
Don&#8217;t mill around for long at your convergence point&#8212;be 
timely, and get moving. It can happen that the Bloc has 
a difficult time getting out into the field of action, once 
it has gathered. One of the best options at a mass action 
is to have the Bloc form somewhere outside the area of heavy 
police presence, and move into it (uh, if that&#8217;s really 
where you need to go! maybe you should consider what you 
could accomplish in the other direction&#8230;) as part 
of a much larger group, before separating to act as a Bloc. 
When moving with a mass of others, a Bloc should keep close 
to them as well as tight internally; police may try to push 
in and isolate the Bloc.</p>
<p> Once 
together, stay tight spatially (with the obvious exception 
of the scouts, who need to be further out)&#8212;you need 
to keep police out of your ranks, prevent snatch squads 
from getting in to grab individuals, and also keep your 
friends at your sides rather than strangers or possible 
undercover officers. Banners (reinforced with PVC pipe or, 
far better, if you can get them safely out into the streets, 
great placards made from tough but limber insulation board, 
with hand-holds cut into them; these can be tied or chained 
together, to create a mobile, jointed full size barricade) 
down the front and sides of a group can offer useful barriers 
to this end. Remember, your physical presence and togetherness 
comprise your strength, your readiness to repel police charges 
and foil arrest attempts is your marching permit. If you 
strike when they&#8217;re not prepared to make mass arrests 
or attack with chemical weapons, they&#8217;ll be forced 
to try to intimidate you by singling out individuals for 
attack or arrest; make this impossible, defend each other 
and don&#8217;t back down.</p>
<p> It&#8217;s 
possible to conceal useful materials in an area in advance&#8212;a 
dumpster can be filled with sticks and rocks or spraypaint 
cans. Sensitive materials (such as projectiles) can be transported 
to the action concealed in puppets, and puppets built from 
paper mache over stronger stuff can serve as effective shields&#8212;though 
those poor puppeteers get enough shit from the secret service 
already without suffering on your account too. Keep in mind 
that carrying a bag of rocks, bottles, gasoline, etc. will 
not look good if you get arrested. Don&#8217;t forget, also, 
that with a simple tool it&#8217;s always possible to break 
concrete or asphalt up into projectiles on the spot&#8212;beneath 
the concrete, the paving stones, isn&#8217;t that how the 
old French saying goes?</p>
<p> Everyone 
in your group should have a one-time-only nickname for the 
duration of the planning and action, so you can address 
each other without giving away your identities. Those communicating 
over cell phones or hand-held radios can count on the possibility 
that the police are listening in; it may be wise for those 
doing communications to learn a code of some kind, or at 
least keep in mind what not to say over the air. It can 
also be good for an affinity group or Bloc to learn coded 
announcements in advance, so you can communicate openly 
without anyone else understanding. &#8220;Tighten up!&#8221;, 
&#8220;The pigs are moving in!&#8221;, &#8220;We need to 
break through their lines!&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s time, 
let&#8217;s do it!&#8221;, &#8220;Split up and regroup at 
convergence point B!&#8221; are all examples of typical 
announcements you might want to code. Don&#8217;t use codes 
unnecessarily, or assume that if you just say &#8220;cookie&#8221; 
every time you mean &#8220;molotov cocktail&#8221; it&#8217;s 
going to protect you; clumsy use of code can actually put 
you in greater danger, for the authorities can claim that 
your coded terms stood for more serious things than they 
actually did. Also, don&#8217;t be afraid to make uncoded 
announcements to everyone: &#8220;Don&#8217;t panic, stick 
together!&#8221;, &#8220;We need to get closer and fill 
in this space here, slow down up ahead!&#8221;, &#8220;Medic!&#8221;, 
&#8220;Who can verify what he&#8217;s saying?&#8221;, &#8220;Hold 
the fucking line!&#8221;</p>
<p> In 
the heat of action, it&#8217;s easy for all the structures 
you have set up in your affinity group to dissolve as individuals 
get caught up in new developments. Don&#8217;t lose your 
head and let the mob mentality take over; make sure to stay 
spatially close with your group at all times, keep in communication 
with them about what is happening, don&#8217;t get distracted 
from your role. It might help to have an informal formation&#8212;you 
can stay a couple paces behind a particular companion at 
all times, with another friend always at your side, and 
another behind you, for example. Plans will change, but 
don&#8217;t lose the structures that enable you to change 
them in unison.</p>
<p> Don&#8217;t 
panic, don&#8217;t believe unsubstantiated rumors. You probably 
won&#8217;t get a clear idea of what was going on everywhere 
else during the action until the day after, if you ever 
do; in the midst of everything, it will be easy to get buffeted 
about by waves of faulty information, so resist acting on 
news until you&#8217;ve double-checked it. Don&#8217;t spread 
rumors yourself, and don&#8217;t just tell others your conclusions 
based on what you&#8217;ve seen or heard&#8212;tell them 
what you&#8217;ve seen or heard and let them draw conclusions 
too.</p>
<p> Scouts 
should practice using communication equipment without being 
obvious, and while bicycling, if applicable; those recognized 
as scouts can count on police harassment, which will be 
all the more problematic because they are alone and critical 
to the success of the group. They should be particularly 
quick and alert. Those using radios should make sure they 
have decided together on a channel to use in advance, and 
a backup channel should there be problems.</p>
<p> Barricades 
can be made out of anything from newspaper dispensers to 
burning dumpsters, and can serve to slow police progress 
or simply halt traffic; if you&#8217;ve scouted in advance, 
you should be able to get them in place very quickly, amid 
crowd confusion. Don&#8217;t ever completely block off an 
escape route you may need! In a less confrontational situation, 
you can make it more difficult for the police to follow 
you in an organized line by simply moving the wrong way 
up a one-way street, provided there&#8217;s still traffic 
coming down it. Offensive use of projectiles is serious 
stuff&#8212;one can go to prison for many years, if arrested&#8212;but 
it can serve to keep police at a distance in order to protect 
an area, or provoke them into using tear gas (which may 
actually be a tactic they hoped to avoid). Don&#8217;t begin 
throwing projectiles in a small group that can be surrounded&#8212;save 
it for massive clashes in which the city belongs to the 
police in one direction and the protesters in the other. 
When you throw, do so as part of a large group, from the 
front of the crowd, and maintain a steady hail in the contested 
area. Those behind the throwers can take provide more ammunition 
via bucket brigade.</p>
<p> If 
you&#8217;re planning to do property destruction, come equipped 
with the appropriate tools. Make sure you&#8217;re informed 
about your targets and their weakness or strength; if you 
get in position and strike that felonious blow only to find 
you&#8217;re unable to break the shatter-proof glass, you&#8217;ve 
just risked a lot for nothing. Sometimes spray paint can 
be more eloquent than broken glass: &#8220;Network TV, keep 
your eyes on the issues&#8221; across the front of the smashed 
corporate storefront they&#8217;ll want to film&#8212;or, 
of course, if possible, you can always just spraypaint their 
camera lenses! Stay abreast of the different stations&#8217; 
coverage, so you can offer a pithy retort to the reporter 
who accuses you of interfering with free speech: &#8220;We 
saw your coverage of the social forum last night&#8212;you 
know as well as I do you don&#8217;t care about free speech.&#8221; 
Then disappear into the crowd while he angrily telephones 
his boss.</p>
<p> The 
most dangerous weapons you should probably ever consider 
using in a street confrontation are molotov cocktails. Understand 
that if you use these, you can expect serious reprisals 
from the police; only do so when you&#8217;ve got a police-free 
zone behind you and a sympathetic crowd close by that you 
can escape into without unnecessarily endangering anyone. 
Best case scenario, you split from the angry mass in a small 
team, apply your cocktail, and disappear. Try to aim them 
at property, not officers, if possible. Of course, with 
the government spending thousands of dollars on each officer&#8217;s 
special storm trooper suit, throwing stuff at cops is practically 
a victimless crime (and don&#8217;t give me that shit about 
more police officers than demonstrators going to the hospital 
at the anti-I.M.F. protests in Prague&#8212;first of all, 
how many demonstrators do you think felt safe going to those 
hospitals, and second of all, haven&#8217;t you ever heard 
of offensive injuries?)&#8212;but you&#8217;d be much better 
off throwing paint bombs at them (which can be made from 
glass bottles, light bulbs, hollow Christmas tree ornaments, 
or wax balls filled with paint), or shooting paint gun pellets 
from your slingshot. If they get paint over their clear 
helmets and shields, no one&#8217;s injured, but they&#8217;re 
rendered blind in their expensive armor and have to retreat.</p>
<p> There 
is a variety of police weapons that may be deployed against 
you: pepper spray, tear gas, water cannons, concussion grenades, 
rubber bullets, clubs, charging horses or vehicles. Know 
what to expect in each situation, and be prepared. Sometimes 
the best defense really is a good offense; a Bloc prepared 
to act more quickly and courageously than law enforcers 
expect can disable a water cannon before it is employed 
against them. Tear gas canisters can be thrown back at the 
police, but they will be extremely hot when they land; if 
you expect to be doing this, make sure you have on welding 
gloves or other serious protection from heat, and that you 
have a good enough throwing arm and aim to get them out 
of the area entirely. Don&#8217;t pick them up until they 
begin releasing gas&#8212;they may explode and injure you. 
Horses may balk at approaching an area where things are 
on fire; a less confrontational mass can deter a horse charge 
by all sitting or lying down.</p>
<p> Police 
will endeavor to disperse unwanted crowds when they are 
not prepared to arrest them. Tear gas, concussion grenades, 
horse charges, rubber bullets, etc. may be employed first, 
if the mass seems particularly rowdy; then, when they deem 
it safe, the officers will move in. They will probably do 
so in lines, charging and falling back to regroup and consolidate 
their gain before charging again. Violent individual arrests 
will take place at this time to intimidate the mass, unless 
the side of the throng facing them is tight-knit and protected 
by barricades or united by linked arms. While the crowd 
seems volatile and daring, the police may well keep a distance; 
if the crowd is confused, passive, or disintegrating, they 
may move in to form lines in its midst, to speed the process 
along. At no point should you panic and run&#8212;this can 
only increase your chances of charging into trouble, and 
endanger others in the process; if others start running, 
shout out &#8220;Walk, don&#8217;t run!&#8221; At the same 
time, keep moving quickly, keep things chaotic to prevent 
the police from getting a sense of where their opponents 
are or what to expect; never let them come together inside 
the mass.</p>
<p> If 
you are on the street, they will attempt to force you onto 
the sidewalk; this thins the crowd, lowers morale, and puts 
you a step closer to being cornered. If you are forced onto 
the sidewalk, you can use a street crossing or turn onto 
a side street to retake the asphalt; banner-carriers can 
rush forward and block the space to be taken while it is 
filled with people, as can bicyclists. The same goes for 
other lanes of traffic, if they are endeavoring to limit 
you to the one you have seized. If the police cannot get 
everyone onto the sidewalk, they will at least try to scare 
the less militant in the crowd into moving onto it and adopting 
a spectator role, so they can then deal with the hard core 
contingent; in this case, try to keep moving and circulating 
so the &#8220;spectators&#8221; can be absorbed again, though 
of course if you are moving in a tight Bloc you don&#8217;t 
want to lose your cohesion in such a situation. In an urban 
environment, it can be possible for an organized, alert 
group to move more quickly on foot than even mounted police 
officers; always keep moving and stay ahead of your foes. 
Sudden bursts of speed and changes in direction can keep 
them particularly confused&#8212;just make sure your group 
can engage in these without itself becoming confused or 
divided. To coordinate simultaneous action in large groups, 
you can shout out a countdown from ten to one.</p>
<p> Police 
snatch squads can be sent into a crowd to grab individuals 
the police consider leaders or dangerous (or who have been 
observed committing a crime). Sometimes you can clearly 
see the commanding officer point out an individual to be 
snatched (this can also be the case if there is an officer 
firing rubber bullets&#8212;another officer may be picking 
out the targets for him, and by watching you can tell who 
is about to be targeted). The squad will attempt to surround 
the target, while keeping an open corridor back to police 
lines. To protect against this, keep a close watch on police 
movements&#8212;they may form a straight line perpendicular 
to the mass before pushing in. If you know who the target 
is, get them out of the area and into different clothing. 
Put your body between approaching officers and the target; 
keep moving and obstructing their path, while making it 
seem as accidental as possible, so as not to become a target 
yourself. If a group can isolate and surround individual 
officers that have entered a crowd, these will back off 
if they don&#8217;t feel in control.</p>
<p> Others 
can attempt to unarrest individuals who have been nabbed. 
The time to do this is as soon as the police strike, before 
they have made their way back to their lines. You&#8217;ll 
need a few people to break the officers&#8217; grip and 
others to block their path. As soon as your comrade is free, 
link arms and disappear immediately into the crowd. The 
squad will probably try to snatch again, and will aim for 
the unarresters now too; keep in mind that unarresting may 
result in more serious criminal charges than the original 
target would have faced, so only hazard it if you have a 
good chance of success or the stakes are too high not to. 
It has happened before that police vehicles surrounded by 
an angry crowd have been forced to release arrestees, but 
they have to be trapped there, not just heckled. If their 
tires are punctured (stick the sidewall, not the tread), 
that will force them to a halt, but popping tires can be 
loud&#8212;again, don&#8217;t try this unless you&#8217;re 
in a trusted crowd with cover in range.</p>
<p> If 
you are grabbed by police, keep in mind that even self-defense 
of the mildest sort can result in assault charges. If you 
expect your companions to try to snatch you back, keep the 
arresting officers&#8217; job difficult by continuing to 
move, or else go limp: this will not result in assault charges 
(though &#8220;resisting arrest&#8221; is not unheard of), 
and will force the officers to work much harder to move 
you. Bear in mind that going limp may provoke them into 
being even more violent to you. If every arrest they make 
costs them a lot of manpower and time, your friends will 
be in a better position to escape or attempt to rescue you.</p>
<p> There&#8217;s 
always the chance that the police will totally surround 
your group and arrest you one by one. If this occurs, you&#8217;re 
in trouble. The best defense is to keep abreast of police 
movement by means of scouts: they may attempt to move up 
side streets to surround you, or lure you forward while 
sending a line around to cut off your retreat. If you find 
your group surrounded by police lines that are thin in one 
direction, you can attempt to charge out: use your own tight 
front line, protected with a barrier (banner, shields, fencing, 
linked arms at the least), to push as a solid wall, potentially 
with a plow point at the very front to divide them. A Bloc 
once used a wheelbarrow appropriated from a construction 
site to front a charge that broke through police lines. 
Apply this tactic as soon as possible after you&#8217;ve 
been encircled, before they are entirely sure of the situation, 
and with maximum confidence if you want it to work. Often 
your best chance to escape will be all together as a cohesive 
group; this also allows you to keep your equipment and clothing 
in the process, so you can maintain your effectiveness as 
a Bloc, even if you only choose to use it to escape. On 
the other hand, if you are part of a crowd that is moving 
into what you think is a trap, it may be wisest just to 
disappear onto the sidewalk and out of your Bloc gear before 
you enter a space you can&#8217;t escape. If you are hopelessly 
trapped, make sure you ditch all incriminating items before 
you are arrested, hopefully in such a way that they cannot 
be connected to you.</p>
<p> Remember 
that the police won&#8217;t be able to make mass arrests 
unless they have lots of plastic handcuffs and vans or busses 
in the area, so these can be a good tip-off for what to 
expect. The same goes for chemical weapons; if they&#8217;re 
ready to use tear gas, they&#8217;ll all be wearing gasmasks 
themselves.</p>
<p> Think 
about what the goals of the police will be, and how these 
affect your options: if they are trying to keep a parade 
route or fenced area secure, you may actually have free 
run of other areas for some time. If they are trying to 
keep a massive march under observation, they will have to 
split their forces to keep up with a breakaway march; this 
will only be difficult for them if they are unprepared in 
numbers, of course, but in certain situations it may be 
true that ten groups of fifty are much more effective than 
one group of five hundred. There will be moments during 
unexpected developments when they are paralyzed waiting 
for orders; take advantage of these&#8212;but if an unusually 
long period passes without police activity, it may be an 
indication that they have a trick up their sleeves, such 
as a new, more heavily armed and armored force massing nearby.</p>
<p> At 
an action the powers that be see coming, you can expect 
to be under surveillance by undercover officers, and you 
may have to deal with agents provocateurs, too. Stay aware 
of those around you, especially strangers; undercover agents 
may be easy to identify (pairs of big men with two days 
of stubble on their faces, nice wristwatches, and communications 
equipment), or very difficult to. Keep your companions aware 
of every person you suspect, but don&#8217;t &#8220;out&#8221; 
undercover agents unless you are absolutely sure they are 
agents (for example, one of your scouts has been following 
one, and seen him chatting with his coworkers), and something 
concrete can be gained from it. Unsubstantiated accusations 
between demonstrators can only make situations more tense 
and demonstration environments less welcoming. As for agents 
provocateurs and just plain stupid people, they may be moving 
among or near you, smashing locally owned stores and private 
vehicles; whether or not you can prove they are cops or 
allies thereof, you can certainly make it clear to them 
that what they are doing is unacceptable and has to stop. 
Don&#8217;t get snarled up in a tactical debate in the middle 
of an action, just make your point (or, in a worst case 
scenario, intervene) and get on with things.</p>
<p> Stay 
aware of others, too, besides the police; other demonstrators 
of more &#8220;liberal&#8221; or authoritarian bents may 
take it upon themselves to interfere your activities, unmasking 
you, assaulting you, or pointing you out to authorities; 
the same goes for local civilians. Never, ever respond to 
this with violence; walk away, or run if necessary. A direct 
action that turns into a brawl with locals or other activists 
is disastrous for everyone. Attempt to talk out differences, 
if this appears possible and worthwhile, when tempers have 
cooled, in a safe space removed from the immediate action; 
send a spokesperson if necessary, preferably a supporter 
from outside the Bloc. At the least, this can distract the 
meddlers while the rest of the group moves on to other actions.</p>
<p> As 
crazy as things get, remember that the police have firearms, 
and there&#8217;s rarely any reason to risk getting killed 
for an action. A street confrontation with better-armed 
police officers is almost always going to be something more 
of a spectacle of confrontation than a no-holds-barred, 
life-or-death battle; there&#8217;s no shame in this fact, 
it&#8217;s just important to take into account. The police 
are restricted in what they can do by what public opinion 
will decree about it; you are limited in what you can do 
by a similar question, for whenever you move up to a more 
confrontational tactic the police will immediately upgrade 
their tactics to a level higher than yours. In this sense, 
streetfighting is a matter of chivalry for us radicals: 
we always permit our opponents the more powerful tools, 
in order to keep the violence from getting too out of hand&#8212;and, 
of course, to show off how much more noble and courageous 
we are! If the papers read (as they have before) &#8220;Violence 
erupted when activists began throwing back tear gas canisters 
fired by the police,&#8221; it will be clear to everyone 
what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p> Stay 
flexible, tactically. If you showed up in riot gear for 
a confrontation with the police, but find yourselves totally 
outnumbered and unprepared, you can turn the other direction 
and move through nearby neighborhoods picking up trash and 
beautifying the area&#8212;that&#8217;ll give the media 
a confusing message to distort!</p>
<p> Once 
again, all this will be very different if you are applying 
the Bloc tactic outside the demonstration setting. Rather 
than engaging in a confrontation with the police which you 
hope will be contagious, or at least risking the possibility, 
you will probably be doing everything you can to avoid encountering 
the police. Scouts, in this case, will serve more to warn 
you about the approach of the police than to monitor the 
lumbering movements of nearby police forces, and, accordingly, 
may be better posted at freeway overpasses or in disguise 
outside the liquor store than on bicycles.</p>
<p> Escape: 
at the end of the action, the final remaining challenge 
is to get out of your gear and disappear. Layers, once again, 
are key: under your Bloc clothing, you should be wearing 
clothing that will make you blend easily with whatever liberal 
protesters or civilians will be in the area. You may have 
to get down to this layer at an instant&#8217;s notice: 
for instance, if the police have singled you out and are 
pursuing you. Make sure it&#8217;s a quick and easy transition 
to make (though not one that can happen accidentally, in 
the midst of the action!). Try to do this in a mass of inattentive 
people, or around a corner or in a bush; if you&#8217;re 
seen or caught on camera changing, all that trouble you 
went to masking up may be wasted. Hopefully you have a clever 
escape route or two already planned out: an inconspicuous 
alley, an open space too wide for any police barricade to 
block, a fence you can climb more quickly than any pig officer. 
If possible, you might want to lock a bicycle somewhere 
nearby, so once you&#8217;ve gotten away you can hop on 
that and move quickly; in urban environments, you can also 
try to get a taxi (provided they&#8217;re out and about), 
or get on the subway (though in a serious situation this 
may be shut down, or the police checking people coming in), 
or duck into a restaurant and just eat fries in a quiet 
corner in your civilian disguise until things quiet down. 
Unless things have gotten really hairy, you should still 
be with your partner, if not a few members of your affinity 
group.</p>
<p>Finally, 
the number one rule of all direct action: quit while you&#8217;re 
ahead. Take things as far as you can, but live to fight 
another day, unless this really is the Last Battle.</p>
<h3>Afterwards</h3>
<p> After 
the action, gather again in your affinity group at a place 
and time safely removed from danger and surveillance. Give 
everyone a space to share how they&#8217;re feeling. Discuss 
and critique what happened, what you learned from it, what 
it means for the future. If applicable, make sure to report 
on your conclusions to other affinity groups who were involved, 
and seek their feedback as well. If any of you have been 
arrested or are facing other difficulties such as injury, 
discuss how to handle this. Celebrate your achievements, 
offer emotional support, swear and plot revenge if need 
be. Make sure above all that everyone involved knows they 
are loved and supported.</p>
<p> Don&#8217;t 
ever brag about your achievements in a Bloc, or share anything 
others don&#8217;t need to know, especially if it could 
incriminate someone. Keep in mind that it&#8217;s possible 
you&#8217;ve been caught on camera and, however carefully 
disguised you were, identified by the authorities. In Sweden, 
a few months after a street confrontation at a meeting of 
the European Union, early one morning the police arrived 
at the residences of a couple dozen activists who had been 
involved and arrested them all at the same moment. That&#8217;s 
a worst case scenario&#8212;don&#8217;t let it make you 
paranoid. Just stay aware of the dangers; if you&#8217;re 
doing a lot of heavy stuff, or organizing for it, you might 
want to live in such a way that your enemies would be hard-pressed 
to know where to find you any given morning.</p>

Account:</h2>
<p> Local 
anarchists and Earth First!ers wanted to make an offensive 
strike against a biotechnology company whose crimes had 
not been brought to public attention (in fact, the corporation 
had bribed the local town government). There was considerable 
discussion about what tactics to use&#8212;and there was 
a huge variety of tactical differences, with some of us 
committed to non-violence and others being wild militant 
anarcho-primitivists! Being from small towns in an area 
not well-known for having lots of activists, we had to work 
together to allow everyone to participate at whatever level 
they were comfortable. The non-violent folks could have 
dropped a banner, or someone might have come at night and 
shredded the crops, but what could be done that would allow 
us to work together, be safe, damage this evil corporation, 
and provide a wake up call such as our placid small towns 
had never seen before? What better than the &#8216;bloc&#8217;! 
Who says we need a major mobilization or a giant anti-war 
protest to use such tactics? We can have the excitement 
and the action of any global day of action any day of the 
week in our own town. It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s 
more state to smash in Washington D.C., Genoa, or Seattle 
than there is in our own neighborhoods. Not only that, but 
this time the cops wouldn&#8217;t be ready for us.</p>
<p> Since 
we were going to combat biotechnology, it made more sense 
for us to dress in biohazard suits than in black&#8212;not 
only did they disguise us, but they got our message across 
by themselves. Bought in bulk, they were less than three 
dollars each. The suits lacked face masks, so we made a 
quick trip down to the hospital for them. We started spreading 
news of the action to our friends by word of mouth, keeping 
our bloc limited to only those we trusted.</p>
<p> Committed 
folks drove in from out of town and set up a &#8216;base 
camp&#8217; for the action at a local farm, building banners, 
preparing flags, writing flyers and media releases. The 
excitement was contagious: local puppeteers brought down 
a gargantuan puppet of an indigenous farmer, and a local 
farmer wanted to dig up the front lawn of the biotechnology 
company to plant organic seeds. Work was spontaneously and 
naturally divided among teams: media, art, etc. The media 
team made different pamphlets for different people&#8212;one 
for the corporate media, one for people walking down the 
street, even one for the employees working there to explain 
to them what was happening. As time progressed and more 
and more car-loads of people drove down the dirt road to 
the farm, we knew that Monday morning, our day to strike, 
was going to be larger than we expected.</p>
<p> We 
had picked our target in complete secrecy, and only a few 
people knew its name and location. If somehow word had leaked 
to the biotechnology company that we were planning something, 
our action would have been ruined. Unlike many blocs at 
protests, we didn&#8217;t have a horde of protesters to 
serve as a distraction, so the main element in our favor 
was surprise. We told everyone else to trust us&#8212;it 
was going to be a biotechnology target somewhere nearby&#8212;and 
that we had scoped it out. Indeed, we had discovered that 
the entire complex, one of the main research centers for 
a biotechnology company, had only a few security guards!</p>
<p> This 
company had genetically engineered corn to feature &#8220;traitor 
seeds,&#8221; seeds modified to be dependent on their expensive 
pesticides. Farmers would purchase these cheap seeds, and 
then go into debt buying the pesticide, losing their land 
and livelihood. This destruction of small and indigenous 
farming and of biodiversity was leading to huge demonstrations 
in Brazil and India in which these crops were ripped from 
the ground and the seeds burnt, in public! These seeds were 
being designed right down the street&#8212;and no one even 
knew about it. The company was so smug they didn&#8217;t 
even hire much in the way of security. Everyone agreed that 
it was a worthy target, and everyone from pacifists to militants 
was happy with keeping the exact location secret until the 
day of action.</p>
<p> The 
night before, we went over a map, including aerial photos 
(which are easily downloaded from the internet&#8212;try 
www.terraserver.) and detailed maps. We didn&#8217;t give 
away the precise location except to one driver from each 
of the cars. People were given an all-too-quick training 
on un-arresting and bloc techniques, and communication equipment 
was distributed among the affinity groups. This lack of 
training, especially considering most of the participants 
had never been part of a bloc, was a great mistake. Still, 
affinity groups had come together naturally over the few 
days before the action, everyone joining groups with close 
friends who wanted to risk the same level of arrest and 
participate in the same type of action. Without any argument 
or coercion, autonomous groups had formed for a truly diverse 
range of actions: climbing on the roof of the building and 
dropping banners, digging up the front yard of the biotechnology 
company to plant seeds, doing independent media work, passing 
out flyers on the sides of nearby highways to the traffic 
that would be snarled by the spectacle we were to create, 
performing in a play involving the giant indigenous farmer 
puppet, acting as police liaisons (a police liaison is a 
person whose job is basically to delay the police by acting 
as the &#8216;spokesperson&#8217; for the group), and, of 
course, property destruction. Surprisingly, there was no 
predictable conflict about violence versus non-violence; 
everyone felt that they were participating in a collective 
action in which every group and every action was vital to 
the overall success of the whole project&#8212;the project 
at hand being to utterly humiliate a biotechnology company 
that had counted on no one even knowing they existed.</p>
<p> At 
the crack of dawn, everyone put on their biotechnology suits, 
double-checked their props, and jumped into their cars. 
We parked in the parking lots of a nearby hotel and family 
restaurant, and ran into the front yard of the massive biotechnology 
complex. Immediately groups scrambled up onto the roof and 
dropped banners; other groups began spray-painting &#8216;Fuck 
Biotechnology&#8217; and &#8216;Free the Seed&#8217; on 
the walls of the building. Giant banners were unfurled, 
and within minutes an unearthly play began, with groups 
of biotechnology-suited people and a traditionally-dressed 
farmer tearing up the carefully manicured lawn of the company, 
planting organic seeds, while giant biotechnology corn visuals 
were erected facing the highway. The employees of the company 
must have thought one of their own experiments had gone 
horribly awry, and fled inside, locking their doors and 
staring out the windows. The security guards, vastly outnumbered, 
just watched with mouths agape. This entire action was visible 
from the highway, and more participants dressed in biohazard 
suits handed our flyers out and carefully talked through 
the issues with passing traffic&#8212;traffic that soon 
ground to a halt. Within fifteen minutes, our action had 
completely paralyzed one of the largest biotechnology companies 
in the world and had frozen traffic on one of the major 
highways in the United States. Of course, it was the cops 
that actually shut down the highway&#8212;maybe in fear 
the public would see the spectacle ahead.</p>
<p> Of 
course the cops did come eventually&#8212;although, due 
to the element of surprise, we had free run of the place 
for almost an hour. Even when the first cops arrived, they 
realized like the security guards that they were outnumbered 
by a large mass of maniacs in biotech suits. They tried 
&#8220;talking&#8221; to our police liaisons, who repeatedly 
told them we had to consult with each other on any decision, 
a delaying tactic that enabled us to get more of the action 
done&#8212;a mistake in retrospect, since that was when 
we should have re-grouped and prepared for the inevitable 
police assault. Even after reinforcements arrived, the cops 
were afraid to act until some of the businessmen came out 
of the office and whispered in their ears. A few of the 
officers began trying to arrest people, starting by arresting 
the only person they could identify&#8212;the farmer. Unfortunately, 
all the affinity groups were so absorbed in carrying out 
the actions they had planned they let some precious seconds 
pass before they could act&#8212;and by then the police 
managed to pepper-spray one individual in the face. However, 
through quick thinking, our white biotech suit disguises, 
and some ridiculously brave unarresting techniques (including 
giving cops wedgies and pulling people free from their grasp) 
we managed to protect almost everyone from arrest.</p>
<p> At 
this point the bloc had become a very loose cluster of affinity 
groups, most folks not even spatially near each other, which 
played into the hands of the cops. When calls to &#8216;bloc 
up&#8217; were made, it soon became apparent most people 
didn&#8217;t have any idea what we were talking about, and 
had little grasp that by gathering together as a larger 
group we could stand off the cops&#8212;a difficulty due 
to our lack of training beforehand. Still, when cops came 
out on bikes, protesters nimbly jumped over fences to avoid 
them, leading one cop to a near-collision with the fence! 
For a good fifteen minutes pure pandemonium reigned, with 
cops unsuccessfully chasing protesters and protesters swarming 
outside the cops&#8217; grasp without evacuating the premises 
of the company. The farmer chose to be arrested non-violently 
while the person who was pepper-sprayed was finally cuffed 
after a considerable battle. Finally, the cops settled down 
and agreed to let us move our protest off the premises. 
Rescuing our giant banners, we managed to regroup our scattered 
forces and make a quick getaway to our cars. Altogether, 
out of fifty-some people at the action, there were three 
arrests. </p>
<p> We 
tried to make it back to our secret hide-out, only to find 
out the city had sent undercover cops after us. After some 
quick driving, we escaped the police and pulled into a truck 
station&#8212;we had to dispose of our biotech suits, which 
we were still wearing! We went around back to an isolated 
dumpster and began throwing our biotech suits and other 
incriminating evidence inside. Then, to our surprise, we 
noticed a trucker watching us through his shades. He gave 
us a thumbs up and a shady smile. Our victory was all over 
the CB radios!</p>
<p> Reunited 
at our secret hideout, we gathered around and decided to 
march downtown and to the jail. Everywhere, people were 
talking about our action, at diners and in shopping centers, 
old men and young women&#8212;no one had seen it coming, 
and people got the message! Not only that, but almost everyone 
was supportive&#8212;&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re 
putting that in our food,&#8221; &#8220;they&#8217;re messing 
with God&#8217;s creation,&#8221; &#8220;that company&#8217;s 
just out to make money regardless of the cost to this town 
or the world&#8221; &#8230;I had never before seen such 
a positive reaction to an action. When we finally got to 
the jail, our boring little town was scandalized&#8212;as 
was the biotech company!</p>
<p> A 
lawyer agreed to defend the defendants for two hundred bucks, 
and we raised the money through benefit concerts in which 
every style of music from punk to bluegrass was played. 
In court, the cops admitted that due to everyone wearing 
white biotech suits they were unable to identify exactly 
who did what, so they couldn&#8217;t really make any charges 
stick. At the end, the defendants were let off with community 
service and the cops even apologized!</p>
<p> As 
in any action, there were things that went wrong and things 
that went right. We definitely had free run of the place 
for a while, and could have inflicted much more serious 
damage on the biotechnology company than we did&#8212;at 
the risk of possibly alienating some people. Given the weight 
of the issue, it probably would have been worth it. We definitely 
should have done more unarresting trainings&#8212;the methods 
we used, like jumping and wrestling with cops, may be courageous, 
but are not recommended. We could have also used a good 
bloc training&#8212;people didn&#8217;t really respond when 
folks called out &#8216;bloc up&#8217; to tighten our ranks. 
Fifty people together could definitely have stood up the 
cops, but when people panicked and began running around 
as lone individuals, the cops managed to nab them. Lastly, 
we should have had a lawyer ready ahead of time. Still, 
hindsight is always clearer than foresight, and the creative 
use of bloc tactics with great public outreach made this 
an action people in our small town will be talking about 
for years&#8212;and one that&#8217;s caused the biotechnology 
company considerable grief and expense. </p>
<p> There 
are some that say the bloc is dead, but it is only as dead 
as the ideas that motivate it. Trying to repeat Seattle 
is going to fail: those ideas died after they were employed, 
but they were well and alive at the time because they were 
new and creative: the cops couldn&#8217;t see them coming. 
Don&#8217;t just think about previous blocs, look around 
you for living inspiration. The real question is not whether 
the bloc is dead or alive, but what ideas we can come up 
with for striking the next blow against capitalism. May 
that next blow be a killing one! </p>
