<h3>I. Normalcy</h3>
<p> People from the (rapidly splintering) "mainstream" of society in Europe 
and the United States today take a peculiar pleasure in considering themselves 
"normal" in comparison to legal offenders, political radicals, and other 
members of social outgroups. They treat this "normalcy" as if it is an 
indication of mental health and moral righteousness, regarding the "others" 
with a mixture of pity and disgust. But if we consult history, we can 
see that the conditions and patterns of human life have changed so much 
in the past two centuries that it is impossible to speak of any lifestyle 
available to human beings today as being "normal" in the natural sense, 
as being a lifestyle for which we adapted over many generations. Of the 
lifestyles from which a young woman growing up in the West today can choose, 
none are anything like the ones for which her ancestors were prepared 
by centuries of natural selection and evolution. </p>
<p> It is more likely that the "normalcy" that these people hold so dear 
is rather the feelings of normalcy that result from conformity to a standard. 
Being surrounded by others who behave the same way, who are conditioned 
to the same routines and expectations, is comforting because it reinforces 
the idea that one is pursuing the right course: if a great many people 
make the same decisions and live according to the same customs, then these 
decisions and customs must be the right ones. </p>
<p> But the mere fact that a number of people live and act in a certain 
way does not make it any more likely that this way of living is the one 
that will bring them the most happiness. Besides, the lifestyles associated 
with the American and European "mainstream" (if such a thing truly exists) 
were not exactly consciously chosen as the best possible ones by those 
who pursue them; rather, they came to be suddenly, as the results of technological 
and cultural upheavals. Once the peoples of Europe, the United States, 
and the world realize that there is nothing necessarily "normal" about 
their "normal life," they can begin to ask themselves the first and most 
important question of the next century: Are there ways of thinking, acting, 
and living that might be more satisfying and exciting than the ways we 
think, act, and live today? </p>
<h3>II. Transformation</h3>
<p> If the accumulated knowledge of Western civilization has anything of 
value to offer us at this point, it is an awareness of just how much is 
possible when it comes to human life. Our otherwise foolish scholars of 
history and sociology and anthropology can at least show us this one thing: 
that human beings have lived in a thousand different kinds of societies, 
with ten thousand different tables of values, ten thousand different relationships 
to each other and the world around them, ten thousand different conceptions 
of self. A little traveling can still show you the same thing, if you 
get there before Coca-Cola has had too much of a head start. </p>
<p> That's why I can't help but scoff when someone refers to "human nature," 
invariably in the course of excusing himself for a miserable resignation 
to our supposed fate. Don't you realize we share a common ancestor with 
sea urchins? If differing environments can make these distant cousins 
of ours so very distant from us, how much more possible must small changes 
in ourselves and our interactions be! If there is anything lacking (and 
there sorely, sorely is, most will admit) in our lives, anything unnecessarily 
tragic or meaningless in them, any corner of happiness that we have not 
yet thoroughly explored, then all that is needed is for us to alter our 
environments accordingly. "If you want to change the world, you first 
must change yourself," the saying goes; we have learned that the opposite 
is true. </p>
<p> And there is another valuable discovery our species has made, albeit 
the hard way: we are capable of absolutely transforming environments. 
The place you lie, sit, or stand reading this was probably altogether 
different a hundred years ago, not to mention two thousand years ago; 
and almost all of those changes were brought about by human beings. We 
have completely remade our world in the past few centuries, changing life 
for almost every kind of plant and animal, ourselves most of all. It only 
remains for us to experiment with executing (or, for that matter, not 
executing) these changes intentionally, in accordance with our needs and 
desires, rather than at the mercy of irrational, inhuman forces like competition, 
superstition, routine. </p>
<p> Once we realize this, we can claim a new destiny for ourselves, both 
individually and collectively. No longer will we be buffeted about by 
powers that seem beyond our control; instead, in this exploration of ourselves 
through the creation of new environments, we will learn all that we can 
be. This path will take us out of the world as we know it, far beyond 
the farthest horizons we can see from here. We will become artists of 
the grandest kind, painting with desire as a medium, deliberately creating 
and recreating ourselves&mdash;becoming, ourselves, our own greatest work. </p>
<p>To accomplish this, we'll need to learn how to coexist and collaborate 
successfully: to see just how interconnected all our lives are, and finally 
learn to live with that in mind. Until this becomes possible, each of 
us will not only be denied the vast potential of her fellows, but her 
own potential as well; for we all make together the world that each of 
us must live in and be made by. The other thing that is lacking is the 
knowledge of our own desires. Desire is a slippery thing, amoebic and 
difficult to pin down, let alone keep up with. If we're going to make 
a destiny out of the pursuit and transformation of desire, we first must 
find ways to discover and release our loves and lusts. For this, not enough 
experience and adventure could ever suffice. So the makers of this new 
world must be more generous and more greedy than any who have come before: 
more generous with each other, and more greedy for life! </p>
<h3>III. Utopia</h3>
<p> Even from here, I can taste the question already on the tip of your 
tongue: isn't this utopian? </p>
<p> Well, of course it is. You know what everyone's greatest fear is? It 
is that all the dreams we have, all the crazy ideas and aspirations, all 
the impossible romantic longings and utopian visions can come true, that 
the world can grant our wishes. People spend their lives doing everything 
in their power to fend off that possibility: they beat themselves up with 
every kind of insecurity, sabotage their own efforts, undermine love affairs 
and cry sour grapes before the world even has a chance to defeat them... 
because no weight could be heavier to bear than the possibility that everything 
we want is possible. If that is true, then there really are things at 
stake in this life, things to be truly won or lost. Nothing could be more 
heartbreaking than to fail when such success is actually possible, so 
we do everything we can to avoid trying in the first place, to avoid having 
to try. </p>
<p> For if there is even the slightest possibility that our hearts' desires 
could be realized, then of course the only thing that makes sense is to 
throw ourselves entirely into their pursuit and risk that heartbreak. 
Despair and nihilism seem safer, projecting our hopelessness onto the 
cosmos as an excuse for not even trying. So we remain, clutching our resignation, 
as secure as corpses in coffins ("better safe and sorry")... but this 
still cannot ward off that dreadful possibility. Thus in our hopeless 
flight from the real tragedy of the world, we only heap upon ourselves 
false tragedy, unnecessary tragedy, as well. </p>
<p> Perhaps this world will never conform perfectly to our needs&mdash;people 
will always die before they are ready, perfect relationships will end 
in ruins, adventures will end in catastrophe and beautiful moments be 
forgotten. But what breaks my heart is the way we flee from those inevitable 
truths into the arms of more horrible things. It may be true that every 
man is lost in a universe that is fundamentally indifferent to him, locked 
forever in a terrifying solitude&#151;but it doesn't have to be true that some 
people starve while others destroy food or leave fertile farms untilled. 
It doesn't have to be true that men and women waste their lives away working 
to serve the hollow greed of a few rich men, just to survive. It doesn't 
have to be that we never dare to tell each other what we really want, 
to share ourselves honestly, to use our talents and capabilities to make 
life more bearable, let alone more beautiful. That's unnecessary tragedy, 
stupid tragedy, pathetic and pointless. It's not even utopian to demand 
that we put an end to farces like these. </p>
<p> If we could bring ourselves to believe, to really feel, the possibility 
that we are invincible and can accomplish whatever we want in this world, 
it wouldn't seem out of our reach at all to correct such absurdities. 
What I am begging you to do here is not to put faith in the impossible, 
but have the courage to face that terrible possibility that our lives 
really are in our own hands, and to act accordingly: to not settle for 
every misery fate and humanity have heaped upon us, but to push back, 
to see which ones can be shaken off. Nothing could be more tragic, and 
more ridiculous, than to live out a whole life in reach of heaven without 
ever stretching out your arms. </p>
