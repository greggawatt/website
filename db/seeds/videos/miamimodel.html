<span class="info">SD / 2003 / 91 Minutes</span>
<span class="desc">Against the prescribed template of paramilitary oppression , information warfare, and profit above all values, activists converge in Miami to demonstrate grassroots resistance, creative action, and international solidarity&mdash;a clash between competing visions of globalization, soon to be known as the<em> Miami Model</em>. Indymedia activists shot hundreds of hours documenting the 2003 FTAA protests in Miami and shaped it into a documentary that cuts through the mass media blackout to reveal the brutal repression and assault on civil liberties that took place, as well as the inspiring alternatives to capitalist globalization that were also in full effect in Miami.
