# Magazine, A CrimethInc. production

Ruby on Rails app that powers https://crimethinc.com

## Development

### tl;dr

[Strap your computer](https://osx-strap.herokuapp.com), first.

```
git clone https://github.com/crimethinc/magazine.git
cd magazine
./script/bootstrap
./script/setup
./script/server
```

## Scripts to Rule Them All

Magazine uses the [Scripts to Rule Them All](http://githubengineering.com/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern.
See also: https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all

`/script` is a collection of scripts for development on an OS X / macOS computer.
Development setup on a Windows or Linux computer may vary.

## Development Scripts

The rest of these instructions assume that you've [strapped your computer](https://osx-strap.herokuapp.com) already. If you haven't, you'll need to install somethings manually. (But really, you're better off using [Strap](https://osx-strap.herokuapp.com).)

- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)
- Homebrew taps and extensions
- Xcode command line tools
- Postgres launchctl (for `setup` script)

### Bootstrap script

The `bootstrap` script is the first time development environment configuration for this app.
You should only need to run this script once.
It will install the proper Ruby and Postgresql database versions.

Clone this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/crimethinc/magazine.git
cd magazine
```

Then run the `bootstrap` script.

```
./script/bootstrap
```

If that fails for you, [file an issue](https://github.com/crimethinc/magazine/issues)
with as much detail about your setup and any errors you got from the script.

### Setup script

After you've `bootstrap`ed, you'll need to `setup`.
The `setup` setups the Rails environment (creates, migrates and seeds databases, then clears logs and tmp).

```
./script/setup
```

#### Can't Load Gem from /vendor Error

If you get an error that some gem can't be loaded, like `bcrypt_ext`, follow these steps to rebuild this repo's dev setup. From the root directory of this repo:

```
rm -rf vendor/gems
rm -rf .bundle
./script/setup
```

### Server script

The `server` script starts the Rails server on port `3000`
(using **Foreman** which uses the `Procile` which uses **Puma**.)

```
./script/setup
```

#### Can't Find Posgresql Error

If you get an error when starting the server that Rails can't connect to the Posgresql server, you can fix it with these steps. (Assuming, you're on a Mac and use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)).

**WARNING:** These step will DELETE all Posgresql databases / software and re-install Posgresql from scratch.
If you have data in your local Posgresql database that you can't re-create after deleting it, you'll want to run some backups first. (That's an exercise for the reader.)

```
brew services stop postgresql
brew uninstall postgresql
rm -rf /usr/local/var/postgres/
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql
```

### Update script

Periodically, you can run the `update` script to check for new versions of dependencies and to update the database schema. If you ever get a `PendingMigrationError`, run this script to migrate your database.

```
./script/update
```

### Test script

Run the test suite using the `test` script.

```
./script/test
```

### Test server script

To run a process which runs tests on file change

```
./script/test_server
```

### Console script

If you need to use the app's console (in any environment), use the `console` script.

```
./script/console
```

If you need to use the console on a remote instance fo the app, specific its enviorment name as the first argument.

```
./script/console production
```

Or

```
./script/console staging
```

### CI Build script

Setup environment for CI to run tests. This is primarily designed to run on the continuous integration server.

```
./script/cibuild
```

### Database seed script

Drop the database, rebuild it, and fill it with seed data.

```
./script/seed
```
